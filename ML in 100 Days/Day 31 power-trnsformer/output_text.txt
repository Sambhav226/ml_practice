'fhe chapters in this book were written at different points in time and
in response to different requirements. Consequently, most of them
could stand on their own and be read in any order. Only the first three
would need to be read together, as the arguments in them are built in
sequence. The chapters can be broadly grouped into three sections.
The first four deal with theoretical debates about feminism and
development; the next three focus on key analytical concepts in
development thought and practice; and the final three examine the
interaction between ideas and practice in relation to some specific
examples of practice.
Since all the chapters were written as a result of my own interest in
exploring the extent to which feminist critiques of mainstream social
sciences in general could be applied to the specific area of develop
ment studies, there are a number of common themes which recur
throughout the book. These provide an underlying framework and a
link between different chapters. One such theme stems from the
concern with the assumptions, procedures and practices by which
feminist perspectives have been either excluded from mainstream
development or else included in a highly diluted or distorted form. A
second recurring theme relates to tracking the connections between
ways of thinking and ways of doing. Reductionist theories within the
social sciences have given rise to reductionist practices, and are in turn
a reflection of reductionist methods. The effects of this are seen most
clearly in relation to gender issues in development, precisely because
women's lives across the world appear to straddle more dimensions
and activities than those of men, and are consequently less easy to
contain within the compartmentalized modes of thought which
characterize some of the mainstream social sciences .

Both gender studies and developn1en1 studies, the 1nain sourtes of
the ideas discussed in this book, cut across disciplinary b<lundaries; in
the context of the Institute of Developn1ent Studies, where I work.
both are also concerned with thinking through the practical implica
tions of theory. Consequently. this h<><>k should hold some interest for
people interested in feminism as well as those interested in develop
ment; for people interested in theory as "'ell as those concerned with
policy. At the san1e time. there will be concepts and debates covered
here that will be familiar to one group but not to another. ·rhis preface
is intended to n1ap out the linkages between these different areas in
01.:9er to n1ake the b<>ok more accessible to a broader group of readers.
f
It w<>uld appear logical to begin such a prefa<:e by providing a
(lefinition of dcvclop1ncnt._However. as son1e of the chapters in the
l>ook make clear, this is not an easy concept to define. Highly
ideologically loaded, it n1eans different things to different people.
Son1e see it in terms of a purposive and planned project; others prefer
to talk of processes of social transf<>rmation. Some define it as the
enhancement of individual choice; others see it as the equalizing of
·opportunities; still others as redistributive justice. Some emphasize
ends; others means; and still others focus on the interrelationship
between ends and means. 1·hese differing perspectives give some idea
of the complexity of the term, and rath_rr_!han putting f<>rward a single
definition in this b<x>k, we will_Q.e ~(E~or11ig, the different notio~of
developn1ent embedded in differing pe.rspectives on gender issues in
development.
A second important clarification at this stage relates to the key actors
in the development field. Some of these actors are immediately
obvious. There are the international financial institutions. like the
Internati<>nal Monetarv Fund and the World Bank, which have
,
become increasingly important in recent decacles in determining the
thrust of national development policies. ·rhere are the multilateral
agencies such as those belonging 10 the United Nations 'fan1ily'. There
are the various agencies of the wealthier nations which are charged
with managing development assistance. There are non-governmental
organizations based in donor countries - for example. Oxfam and
ActionAid in Britain. Then there are the various governn1ents a11d
non-governmental organizations in what is frequently referred to as
1
the 'developing' countries or the 'fhird World. Finally. there are
researchers and consultants in various public and private organiza
tions across the world who play an important role in generating the
inforn1ation which helps to shape how problen1s are identified and
solutions fran1ed.

These different institutional actors cooperate - and conflict - with
each other on the basis of their understanding of problems of
underdevelopment. How these problems are conceptualized will, of
course, have a key bearing on how they are tackled. What is becoming

textbooks on c;l~velopment referred specifically to women. Develop-
ment has been about men, by men and for men. Why was this so?
Urvashi Butalia, a founding member of India's first feminist publish-
ing press, tells of an Indian journalist who published a series of stories
of village life in India, based on his visits to a particular village. He
spoke of the men who owned the land and those who laboured on it, of
their livelihood strategies, of their livestock and poultry, of the crops
and seasons; but he never spoke of the women in the village. When he
was asked why not, his answer was simple: he had not seen any. While
this is a very literal testament to_ )',1611_!fn's invisib~, it stands as an
appropriate metaphor for what"-rrnmy- have identified as the basic
problem of development for women: policymakers simply did no_t 'see·

.
The first wave of official feminism within the international develop-
ment agencies sought, therefore, to make 'women' visible as a category
in development research and policy. This has come to be characterized
as the WID (Women in_ .D_CYrlop~t) approach. There was a
convicti~ that if onfy ·p~ners and policymakers could be made to see
. women's concrete and valuable contribution to the economy, women
would no longer be marginalized in the development process. It soon
became clear, however, that there was more at stake than misconcep
tions and misinformation. The strength, resilience and sheer obstinacy
of mainstream ways of thinking have meant that the accommodation
of women's issues has often been achieved through a process of
pigeonholing. General textbooks might include a chapter on women;
development conferences might timetable one workshop on women,
perhaps even a speaker at a plenary session; development projects may
have a checklist to ensure that 'women's concerns' have been taken into

'
'
form of argument was brought home to me during a workshop on
\
gender-aware planning in Bangladesh when one of the women
participants asked: 'Do you think we are ready for gender and
\.
' development in Bangladesh, when we have not yet addressed the
problems of women in development?' Whe_n she explained how she
understood the difference, it transpired that the new vocab_ulaiy of
gender was being used withit, herorganization to deny the existence of
~omen•specific disadvantage, and hence the need for specific meas-
ures wh,ich n1ight address this disadvantage. Some organizations have
1
thus embraced the shift to gender because it appears to relieve them of
the need to concern themselves with the specific problems that women
face within their internal structures, and with the possibility that male
1
interests within the organization may be actively implicated in creating
J
] these problems.
Yet a relational analysis of gender inequality within the development
process has far-reaching implications. It goes beyond the questions of

work, to looking at the i~Sl!!~~~~-n~~_ze~ -~asis _?f ..' !'ale_ _ pow~r aod

discipline has played such an influential role in shaping development
thought and steering development practice, its theories and concepts
inevitably form a major focus of the critique in this book. Some
examples of economic theorizing surface in the broader discussion on
development in first section, but it is the central concern of this second
section. Attention is now shifted from development in general to
microeconomic concepts, such as households and household decision
making, poverty and the poverty line, costs, benefits and cost-benefit
analysis, efficiency and equity, all of which figure prominently in the
practice of development.

Mancur Olsen offers this lyrical description of the discipline: 'l plead
with them that even if economics seems, when first entered, like a dark
cave, it is a cave that if followed all the way to the end, leads to the other
side of the mountain, and to a magnificent view that includes even
terrain that we conventionally associate with other social sciences.'
This, however, is not a description of economics that will receive
much support here. A more appropriate metaphor would be that of
economics as a bleaka rid -barren ie-rrain ""iri ·which few planes can
flourish ·(a metaphor--which draws on Schumpetet's desct iption of

which characterize the world as we know it, and play a more important
role in the more empirically grounded approaches to social reality. In
each of the three chapters which make up this section, therefore, I
have sought to contrast the economists' version of certain aspects of
social reality with the very different version that comes into view when
a more relational perspective is adopted. What my analysis makes clear

of_jeye_l~p~~nt interve11~i~ns. Here the challenge is to conceptualize
and measure the intaJigible goals of development - in particular,
autonomy and equity. The problen1 is that economists recognize only
che market as the arbiter of value and, by extension, only those costs
, and benefits which can be given a market price. Consequently,

The last three chapters of the book are also about the relationship
between ideas and practice, but focusing here on the way ideas are
evolved, clarified or transformed through the experience of develop
ment policies and practice. ·rhree different kinds of development
practice figure in these chapters. Chapter .8 deals. wit_~ population
; poli~y. It delineates the different meanings of control en1bedded in
conflicting interpretations of the 'unmet need' for reproductive
technology. For the population establishment, the issue is control over
women's bodies and reproductive capacity; for feminists, it is women's
' right to control over their own bodies as an essential aspect of their
sense of selfhood. However, there are differences among feminists as
well in how they see the issue of reproductive control, which mirror
their differing political stance in relation to the broader questions of
development itself. The chapter traces through some of these debates
in order to illuminate how the politics of needs interpretation is played
out in one particular policy arena. It concludes by putting forward a
set of principles and guidelines which might help to construct a more
feminist version of population policy than has hitherto been in
evidence. On a broader theoretical level, the chapter adds weight to
' the argument that choice - reproductive or otherwise - re1nains at the
level of an abstraction unless it is backed up by information, resources,
accou.ntability and, in the final analysis, enfranchisement.

from more conventional forms of development intervention is the
central role given to changing institutional rules, procedures, identi
ties and relationships. The chapter emphasizes the point (made in
Chapter 7) that more conventional approaches to the design and
evaluation of development interventions, which privilege certain
world-views over others, are unlikely to give rise to projects of
enfranchisement and empowerment. ,

structions of gender. It suggests the need to link discussions of gender

inequality to the rules and practices of the different institutions that 1

interact in the development process. And finally, it moves from l
looking at the 'gender subtext' of concepts and policies which have /
figured in the rest of the book to looking at the political subtext of the ,
gender training methodologies under consideration. It reiterates once
again one of the central themes of the book: that ways of thinking and
ways of doing are inseparable. - - - · · · · - ·
As I stated at the beginning of this preface, the chapters in this book
were written at different points in time and in response to different
requirements. I would like to conclude by acknowledging my debts to
colleagues and friends, with the usual proviso that they bear no
responsibility for the analysis contained here. The first four chapters
were written over a number of years in the course of teaching on the
MA in Gender and Development which is run jointly by the Institute of
Development Studies and the University of Sussex. I would like to
thank the various students who have given me feedback on my
lectures, but a particularly warm thank you to MA4.
Chapter 5 was written because of my own interest in household
economics, and has appeared as IDS Discussion Paper 288. However, I
benefited here from an earlier collaboration with Razia Aziz on
developing a teaching module for the Institute of Social Studies in The
Hague; I am grateful for her incisive comments on the earlier paper. I

am also grateful to Diane Elson for her comments on the discussion
paper. Chapter 6 emerged out of a consultancy commissioned by
DAN IDA on behalf of the Like-Minded Group of donors in Bangla
desh. Here I benefited from my discussions with Hussain Zillur
Rahman and Shireen Huq. An earlier version of this chapter appeared
as IDS Discussion Paper 255, and in the journal of Peasant Studi,s, vol.
18 (2). I would like to thank them for letting me include a revised
version of the paper here. Chapter 7 was written in response to a
request from students of the M.Phil. in Development Studies for
'something on gender and cost-benefit analysis'. It has appeared in
Devtlopmml and Change, vol. 23, and I would like to thank them for
letting me include a revised version of the article here.
Chapter 8 was initially commissioned by the Commonwealth Secre
tariat for the Commonwealth Ministers' Meeting in Ottawa in 1990.
An earlier version of the paper appeared as IDS Discussion Paper 299,
and I would like to thank HeatherJ oshi in particular for her comments
at this stage. Chapter 9 was written specifically for this book, as it
seemed impossible to produce a book on gender issues in development
practice without considering the question of empowerment. Finally,
Chapter 10 was written in response to those who asked about the
training methodology we have been developing at IDS. This chapter
appeared earlier as IDS Discussion Paper 313, and received comments
from Gerry Bloom and Ann Marie Goetz. While a number of people
have been involved in developing this methodology, I am particularly
indebted to those I have trained with most recently: Shireen Huq, Ann
Marie Goetz, Ramya Subramaniyam, Shanti Dairiam, Maitrayee
Mukhopadhyay and Deborah Kasente. A brief description of the
conceptual framework has also recently been published as a chapter in
the Oxfam publication Gendn- Planning in Droelopmrot Agtncus: Meeting
tht Challmge ( 1994).
In addition, I would like to make more general acknowledgements
to a number of people who have helped with their comments, advice
and encouragement: Alison Evans, Hilary Standing, Shireen Huq.
Diane Elson, Martin Greeley, Henry Lucas, Gerry Bloom, Robert
Chambers. I owe special thanks to Ann Whitehead, who has been a
source of intellectual leadership for many of us; to Chris Colclough
and John Toye for support at the institutional level, and to the
Overseas Development Administration for research funding to IDS.
At Verso, I would like to thank in particular Robin Blackburn for
suggesting putting this book together, Colin Robinson for seeing it
through, and Robin Gable for his comments on the draft version.
Finally, I have depended enormously on Chris Lears help, suppon
and general forbearance. I owe him special thanks.

PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS XIX
Notes
I Most epithets like 'developing countries' and 'Third World' have been
rightly criticized for imposing an apparent uniformity on an extremely
heteregeneous (culturally, politically and economically) group of countries.
Moreover, with the demise of socialist regimes in much of the world, the
original rationale for the term Third World as connoting a 'third way' to
development for the economies of Africa, Asia and Latin America, different
from the first 'capitalist' path and the second 'socialist' path, is increasingly
irrelevant. However, it remains the term I am most comfortable with, since it
was the basis of my own political education. To replace the term with
'LACAAP countries' (Latin America, Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the
Pacific) may be more accurate and appropriate, but it does not come easily to
me yet. I have therefore mainly used the term Third World in this book.

The Emergence of Women as a
Constituency in Development
After a millennium for men, we got a Decade for Women.
(Participant at the Women's Studies Conference, London
1991)
Considerable effort has been made by the maJor1ty of
countries in furtherance of the objectives of the Decade, but
the progress has been insufficient to bring about the desired
quantitative or quality improvements in the status of women.
(UN 1980, cited in Maguire, 1984, p. 35)
What has been the impact of all this activity? Not much.
(Tinker, 1982, p. II, cited in Maguire, 1984, p. 35)
Women's Issues as Development Issues
One way of charting the emergence of women as a distinctive category
in development discourse is to monitor their changing significance
within the policy declarations and institutional structures of the major
development agencies. Changes within the United Nations, a major
player in this field, provide an illustrative example. Since the start of
the sixties, the UN has marked each official 'decade of development'
with a declaration summarizing the lessons learnt from past exper
ience and its priorities for the coming ten years. The declaration that
announced the First Development Decade (1961-1970) was devoid of
any specific reference to women. A brief reference in the International
Development Strategy for the Second Decade to the importance of
encouraging 'the full integration of women in the total development
effort' hinted at the first glimmerings of a new consciousness. This was

ment should have high returns in ter1ns of increased output, greater
equity and social pr(>gress' (UN. 1989a. p. 41).
·rhe emergence of this new consciousness was also evident in
changes in the organizational structure of the UN. In its early years.
won1en's issues were seen prirnarily in the context of human rights and
c<>nfined to the Con1111ission on the Stalus of Won1en and to the l'hird
c:on1mittee of the UN (~eneral Assernbly. which dealt with social and
hunianilarian n1atters (Pietila and Vickers. I YYO). By the end of the
eighties, there were several organizalions within the UN systen1
resp(>nsible for ensuring that won1en were integrated inlo ilS develop
ment eff<>rls. ·rhey included the Division for Women within ilS central
agency, the United Nations Development Programme, along with the
UN Development Fund for Won1en; the legal <.:ommittee for the
Elin1ination of Discrirnination against Wornen; the International
Research and ·rraining Institute for lhe Advancement for Women, an
autonomous bc><ly within the UN; as well as Won1en in Development
(WID) units within the various bc><lies of lhe UN.
'[his chapter traces this emergence of women as a recognized
conslituency in the developn1ent effort and the changes in policy
discourse which it effected. It is custon1ary to begin accounts of this
history by paying tribute to a bo<,k by Ester Boserup, published in
1970, which is considered a watershed in thinking about women in
development. Indeed, one WID advcx:ate described it as 'the funda
mental texl for the U.N. Decade for Won1en' (Tinker, 1990a, p. 8).
However, the clin1ate might not have been as receptive to Boserup·s
ideas if the period when her bo<>k was published had not also been one
in which various social movements gathered momentum (Maguire.
1984). The sixties and seventies were marked by protest-in the South
against the injustices of the international economic order, and in the
North againsl class and race privilege in lhe universities and factories.
(:ivil-rights and black-power movements combined with l'hird World
liberation struggles to heighten awareness of conttnuing forms of neo
colonialism across the global landscape. The women's n1ovement itself

assumptions. Previously held convictions that the gross national

that the benefits of economic growth would 'trickle down' to house

growth rates of over 5 per cent were documented in many Third

World countries, they were frequently accompanied by increases in
unemployment, inequality and absolute poverty. Dissatisfaction with
growth-dominated definitions of development led to a reformulation
of development goals to take greater account of poverty, distribution
and the meeting of basic needs. In 1970, the UN Development
Strategy for the Second Decade declared that 'the ultimate objective of
development must be to bring about sustained improvement in the
well being of the individual and bestow benefits on all. If undue
privileges, extremes of wealth and social injustice persist, then
development fails in its essential purposes.'
Various elements made up this new broadened view of develop
ment: Redistribution with Growth (Chenery et al., 1974);The Assault on
World Poverty (World Bank, 197 5) and the I LO's E mpwyment, Growth and
Basic Needs: A On,-World Problem ( 1976) were influential publications
and epitomized the new sensitivity to the links between economic and
social objectives. These changes in the ideological climate of develop
ment also resulted in greater attention being given to women's issues.
There were two areas where women's role in development received
particular attention (Pietila and Vickers, 1990). The first was food. The
Food and Agriculture Organization (F AO) nutrition section, staffed
mainly by women, had highlighted women's vital role in food
production, particularly in Africa. It ensured that the World Food
Conference, organized in 1974, recognized women's contributions at
different stages of the food chain, along with their role in family food
provision and nutrition. The second important area was population.
Development studies in the fifties and sixties had been dominated by
ambitious macroeconomic models dealing with highly aggregated
variables that spelt out how to achieve economic growth. A common
assumption of these models (for example, the Coale and Hoover
Model [ 1958)) was that high rates of population growth inhibited a
country's investment capacity; potential economic surpluses were used
up in consumption and welfare expenditures, instead of being
invested in productive capital formation. Supporting this view of 'the
population problem' was the work of economists like Enke (1969) who
argued that a dollar spent preventing births (through contraceptive
measures) added one hundred times more to income per head in a
developing country than it would in other fo rn1s of aid expenditure.

However, despite the encouragen1ent given to family-planning
efforts, birth rates did not go down in the 'I'hird World. The
lin1itations of this approach were partly explained by micro-level social
science research suggesting that improving the supply of family
planning methods was unlikely to have much impact on birth rates if
the conditions that led to the den1and for J;u:ge. families_r_e_mained
unchanged (Mamdani, 1972; Epstein and Jackson, 1977). One of the
most consistent relationships to emerge out of this body of work was
tthat between different indicators of women's status (for example.
~~ ,ed~cation, l~bour-force participation) and fertility rates. As a study
;typical of this genre of research concluded, 'the role and status of

' 1
cleared for such issues to be incorporated into the development
discourse and to take on increasing instrumental value in the achieve
ment of a variety of developn1ent-related goals. The declaration of the
International Decade for Women, with the official themes of Equality,
Peace and Development, signified the new visibility of Women in
Development (WID) in international forums.
It was against this changing, and more receptive, mood within the
development establishment that the far-reaching effects of Boserup's
book and the work of those scholars and advocates loosely labelled
'WID' have to be understood. The advent of WID in the international
arena represented, above all, an infusion of new ideas aimed at
influencing prevailing development policy. Its achievements - and
limitations - are best assessed by locating them in the context of how
women and development had been thought about and 'done' in the
years prior, and subsequent, to the WID intervention. In the rest of
this chapter, we will be outlining some of the different policy
approaches to women in the development arena, before going on in
the next chapter to look at the theoretical underpinnings of WID and
the limitations associated with it.
From Welfare to Efficiency: Policy Approaches to
Women in Development
Buvinic ( 1983) has suggested that approaches to women in develop
ment can be classified as welfare, anti-poverty and equity. (I will
Google Original from

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA5
WOMEN AS A CONSTITUENC Y IN DEVELOPMENT
discuss Buvinic's equity category in terms of equality, to distinguish it
from the equity argument put forward in Chapter 4.) Two further
classifications were added by Moser ( 1989): efficiency and empower
ment. Each of these different approaches represented a response to
distinct sets of imperatives, but they should not be regarded as either
chronological or mutually exclusive. In some agencies, old approaches
persisted as new ones were attempted; in others, older ones were
returned to as new ones foundered. For analytical purposes, however,
welfare and efficiency have been constituted as the two dominant and
cfpposing approaches, located, as it were, at either end of the policy
spectrum. The other approaches can be seen as either transitional
between them or, as in the case of empowerment, yet to be taken
seriously by the official development agencies. We will be discussing
grassroots strategies for women's empowerment in Chapter 9. Atten
tion is focused in the rest of this chapter on policy approaches to
women and development which have featured more explicitly in the
official arena.
WlD emerge9 in the..-l970s, not because women had been totally

because they had been brought into development policy on very ~ 2't, \
s~cific terms. In other words, while men entered the policy process a :'

Uaquette and Staudt, 1988). Consequently, mainstream 'developriie1it' ;
efforts were targeted mainly at the male population, while wome~ 1 I
/
were relegated to the more marginal 'welfare' sector. As Buvinic put it: 1
Poor women in the Third World had become the main beneficiaries of
w~!~r«:~og~ Jns begun by national and international relief agencies soon
after the end of the World War 11. These welfare programs were designed
lo relieve poor women's needs exclusively in 1erms of their roles as mothers
and housewives. (Buvinic, 1983, p. 24)
Moser ( 1989) has pointed to the origins of the welfare approach
within development in the notion of 'social welfare' embedded in
nineteenth-century European Poor Laws. 'fhis helps to explain the
continuing 'residual' status given to welfare planning in the develop
ment efforts of many of the ex-colonial countries. The Poor Laws came
into existence in Europe at a time when individual effort in the
marketplace was seen as the recommended route to individual
self-improvement. The poor were viewed as the failures of the
system, incapable of improving themselves through their own efforts.

organizations. Later, social welfare n1inistries were set up t~ effect
consun1ption transfers to meet the needs of 'vulnerable groups' who
had been failed by the 'normal structure of supply, the family and the

\then1 by the pre-WID development planners, viz. in programmes
delivering nutritional training, hon1e economics, maternal and child
health care and fa n1ily planning. As long as economic growth was seen
as the overriding objective of developn1ent, these welfare programmes
were very much of a residual nature, offered only when the require
ments of mainstream planning had been met and dispensed with in
times of econon1ic austerity. Won1en entered them passively, rather
If

than i!_Ctively, as reciJ>ients rather than contributors, clients rather than
, ~ agents, reproducuve rather than productive.
Against this background, the publication of Boserup's book in 1970
can1e as a startling revelation. Writing as an economist and a planner,
in language that was familiar to the n1ainstream development
community, she made a strong case for women's productive roles. in
direct challenge to the orthodox equation between women and
don1esticity. She argued that various colonial and post-colonial
governments had systematically bypassed women in the diffusion of
new technologies, extension services and other productive inputs
because of their perceptions - or n1isperceptions - of what women did.
She provided exan1ples of countries where. despite women's critical
roles in farming systems, planners had continually operated with
stereotyped assumptions ah<>ut fen1ale don1esticity.
·rhe initial implication of Boserup's critique, further reinforced by
the WID advocates and scholars wno ca,ne after her, was to shift
attention from welfare to equality for won1en in the development

process. As Maguire has out (1984, p. 12), the World Plan

Conference contained a 'bold women's agenda' which called for 'the
achievement of equality between the sexes within the context of
changed relations between North and South'. It also called for a
reassessment of the family and societal roles assigned to the different
sexes, but focused , in the immediate term, on women's roles and the
establishment of socially organized services to free women to contri
bute equally in economic production. However, this early call for
radical change soon evaporated when the time came for implemen
tation. Put forward as an extensive 'shopping list of desirable changes
in the status of women', it was left to the piecemeal action of individual
governments to put into practice (Maguire, 1984, p. 13). While the
process of rationalizing the original list of demands varied between
different national and international agencies, some consensus was
reached on the main goal: not only to integrate women into the
development process, but to integrate them 'more productively'. The /
1
key route for this integration was seen as equality of opportunity
through education and training.
The Decade rhetoric of equity would have proyed difficult to
trans_l_ate intg-poltey-because it.required a redistribution :of resources
throughout the development process: 'Focusing on all women, rather
than on poor women only, calls for equality at all levels, both among
program beneficiaries and among program implementers' (Buvinic, ~_,,
1983, p. 26). In view of the resistance by predominantly male-staffed
development agencies to redistributionist concerns, equal-opportun-
ity programmes, even in their watered-down versions, presented high
political and economic costs which undermined their chances of
implementation. Instead, the new fQ f~~_on wcroeo was accommodated ,

In other words, over a decade of WID policy has achieved a great deal \ ,A._/

There are, of course, other ways of thinking about the problems of

premisses and question the terms on which development institutions

As long as girls remain under the twofold handicap of a

of training facilities in schools and elsewhere which are
inferior to those given to boys, they are bound to be inferior
workers. (Boserup, 1970, p. 220)
Teaching women better techniques ... as Boserup suggests,

Ideology, Pngmatism and the Making of a Field
Different social actors have been involved in the making of the WID
perspective in development. Tinker ( 1990b) distinguishes between
three categories. There are the scholars who have helped to compile a
wide range of research, of both a theoretical and practical nature, in
response to the informational requirements of various development
institutions (the UN agencies, the bilateral donors, non-governmental
organizations and governments). There are the advocates who have
lobbied powerful policymakers to incorporate women more success
fully into the development process. Finally, there are the practitioners,
women and men working within the various agencies, whose primary
concern is with fulfilling the policy mandate of their institutions to
integrate women into development. These groups have different
concerns, are accountable to different constituencies and subject to
different constraints, all of which shape the nature of their contribu
tions to the interpretation of WID issues. According to Tinker, 'WID
advocates and practitioners, because their objective is to influence the

development community, tend not to raise basic theoretical issues but
rather seek to adjust current development practices to include and
benefit w<>men' ( 1990b, p. 48). Scholars differ in that, 'constrained
neither by the existing governmental systems nor by agency bureau
cracies, they are free to utilize ideologies or images of the future to test
and judge contemporary issues'. Among scholars, however, she
distinguishes between those who share the 'pragmat_k'_ perspectives
and 'non-ideological' stance of WID advocates and pract!ti_<?-f!.ers and
those 'who are consumed with theoretical arguments, however fe;1r t~~y
, • may be removed from reality' (p.48). ·1·he non-ideological stance of
: I WID pragmatists, she suggests, evokes hostility among more theoretic
ally inclined scholars.
'finker is right to emphasize both the in1portance of the differing
institutional constraints within which WID advocates, scholars and
practitioners wor"k and the existence of a common 'pragmatic' agenda
unifying many of them. It is misleading, however, to characterize this
agenda as non-ideological. It can be perceived as non-ideological only

Economic Theory: The Enthronement of Economic
Growth in Development Studies
---
.. .
~
·Y,iberal neo-classical economics has always played a central role in the
evolution of development studies and in the formulation of develop
ment policy. It can be_g~<!ite<:!_~ith _~h~ persisting emphasis given to
economic growth as the pcimary ..g oal. .wd.-meanmg .of -development,

liberal market-oriented models of economic growth have set the broad
parameters for development planning and framed the fluctuating
1
significance accorded to IT@!.~e~, states and non-g<_>vernmental \
organj~tions as alternative agencies of resource allocation in the
development process.
'Econon1ics,' as Lionel Robbins puts it in a widely cited description of
the discipline, 'is the science which studies human behaviour as a
relationship between ends and scarce n1eans which have alternative
uses· ( 1935, p. 16). His description contains many of the key words of

"1the
discipline: behaviour, science, ends, means, scarcity and alm-nativ,s.
The sin1plifying core of economic theory is the as~~mption that all
agents within society are essentially and universally motjv~ed by the
·attempt to maximise their individual utilities or saaisfaction, the ·e11ds'
of eco11omic endeavour. However, because the means at the1rcl1sjx>sal
are limited in relation to their needs, they must decide how to allocate
these means between competing alternative uses in order to maximize
their utilities, viz. achieve the highest possible level of satisfaction. 'fhe
ability to allocate scarce means between competing ends in order to
maximize utility is referred to as 'rational' behaviour. All agents in the
economic universe are utility maximizers although they may define
utility differently: for fir1ns, utility may reside in profit maximization.
while for households, utility may relate to consumption or leisure.
Gi'llt.!l these behaviot!r!!l...prjociples, .the -~<?_nd!ti._on far econQ.mic
growth is seenas mcfividual_~ ~oi~ buttressed by_t bejp~t~tions of
private property and free markets. Individual choice implies the
pursuit of self-defined goals, unimpeded by the value judgements or
co1npulsions of others. Since individual choice is regarded as purely
subjective, no external agent can judge what is best for the individual:
each agent is the best judge of her own self-interest. Liberal economists
are generally reluctant to make evaluative comparisons between
individual wants and preferences. the 'ends' of economic activity.
These are generally taken as exogenously given, viz. outside the
domain of economic analysis. 'fhey focus instead on the 'means' by
which individuals satisfy their wants as an effective index of choice.
Indeed the separation of means and ends is a hallmark of liberal
econon1ics: 'The economist is not concerned with ends as such. He is
concerned with the way in which the attainment of ends is limited. The
ends may be noble or they n1ay be base. l'hey may be "material" or
"immaterial'' ... But if the attainment of one set of ends involves the
sacrifice of others, then it has an econon1ic aspect' (Robbins, 1935. p.
25). Since the means by which human beings achieve their ends are
always limited, individual agents have to compete in order to maximize
their share of the available resources through which they will realize
their subjectively determined ends.
Private property is seen as a critical institutional support for
ensuring rational competitive behaviour. If individuals are not guar
anteed rights to the results of their efforts, there will be no incentive

potential for promoting choice with efficiency. Market prices signal
the existence of scarcities and surpluses within an economy; individual
agents are free to respond as they wish. However, failure to respond
rationally (increasing supplies of a commodity and reducing demand
when its prices are high, and reversing the pattern when prices are
low) will carry penalties which will only disappear when individual
agents have adjusted their behaviour appropriately. As long as
individual agents behave rationally in response to market signals, the
market will ensure that a multitude of potentially conflicting choices
persistently converge towards a 'Pareto-equilibrium': a condition
where no one can become better off without someone else becoming
worse off.
By aggregating the operations of the individual units that make up
the economy, economists build a theory of the behaviour of the entire
economy. Identical behavioural principles are posited as the analytical
focus broadens from individual units to nations. If nations specialize
within the international division of labour, according to the compara
tive advantages bestowed by their pattern of endowments, each nation
concentrating on those commodities which it produces relatively more
cheaply than others and relying on free trade to acquire goods which it
produces relatively more expensively, then the same laissez faire
principles which assure a locally optimal equilibrium will also assure a
globally optimal one.
Neo-classical economics thus claims to offer a nOf\-P.rescriptive or

maximize both individual an·d social good. No value judgments are
attached to these -individual choices. As Solow puts it, 'One of the
elegant showpieces of economics is its analysis of the resource
allocation implications of a system of prices or shadow prices. We have
learned to free this analysis of ethical overtones' ( 1963, p. I 0).
Modernization Theory and Development by Stages
Sociologists staked an early place in development studies, not so
much by questioning the content of the growth models of economists,
but by suggesting that they 'presuppose certain social and cultural
conditions which sociologists are equipped to analyse' (Bernstein,
1979, p. 80). M~~rnization tl:i_~_pr_y_developed attt of this claim. It built
on the analysis of the social .changes that o.ccurrrd in the co_ur.~e of

'non-economic' factors which are likely either to promote or inhibit
economic developn1ent. M<xlernization theory perceived develop
ment as an evolutionary, unilinear process of change "·hich took
societies from their pre-m<xlern status through a series of stages
towards the final destination of nuxlernity. Each stage was different
and superior to the previous one, so development was depicted as a
cumulative pr<>eess of improvement in living standards. Moderniza
tion implied the 'total' transfo rmati<>n of pre-modern societies: their
institutions, their cultures and the behaviours they promoted. Institu
tions became more differentiated and specialized in their functions.
creating a corresponding differentiation and expansion of the possible
roles available to individuals within society. Family and kinship lost its
central place in the institutional structure as many of its earlier
functions were transferred to the now separately constituted and
distinct public spheres of economy and state.
· Modern societies institutionalized individualism. The new roles
available to individuals - and the statuses ass<>eiated with them - were
increasingly achie11ed as a consequence of purposeful individual effort
rather than ascribed by norms and custom. ·rhey involved individuals in
in1personal and specialized interactions. governed by universalistic
standards, in contrast to pre-modern societies whose systems of caste
and patronage brought their occupants into more particularistic and
diffuse relationships. Along with the shift from ascribed to achieved
roles and statuses, 1nodernization encouraged the Aowering of ratio
nal self-interest in place of the earlier reliance on superstition and
tradition as the guiding principles of individual behaviour.
-
While modernization theorists used different combinations of social
,.
' and economic factors to explain the process of change, they generally
~hared a common emphasis on changes in values and attitudes as a
. critical prerequisite for the transition to the m<xlern society. They
attributed the 'backwardness' of the -rhird World to the absence of the
values associated with rational individualism, together with the socio
economic institutions through which such values could flourish and be
rewardect.
Modernization, Economic Growth and the
Rise of the Modem Individual

course of development. Although econ<>mists talked of 'economic

man' in f ree-ffoating, ahistorical terms, they were in fact talking about
a very specific kind of individual:
let us consider the individuals who make up an economy. People have many
and varied wants. . . . Until man has reached a fairly high level of
attainment, the systemisation of these wants and the ordering of prefer
ences within the possibilities permitted to the individual . . . is not possible.
Where this high level has not been reached, ,nan's behaviour will be
determined entirely according to custom or impulse (Morishima, I 976, p.
12).
If modern man was defined as 'a being with a syste,natic will which
conforms with rational rules· (Morishi1na, 1976, p. 13), then certain
preconditions ('a high level of attainment') are necessary to bring him
into existence. 'Modern man' was the product of the modernization
process - Morishima's emphasis is on the educational system as a
vehicle of socialization - and was himself a condition for further
mc,dernization and economic growth. 'Modern' man and 'economic'
man were in fact the same individual and could be characterized by a '
common set of attitudinal variables which made up rational behaviour: /: ,
innovativeness, dynamism, con1petitiveness and risk-taking.
....J
· Arid what about modern woman? Very few of the early development
theorists directly addressed the effects of developn1ent on women, but
those that did offered an optimistic prognosis. It was generally agreed
that women would also benefit from the erosion of primordial
relationships and superstitious beliefs, but differently from men,
because of their different roles in modern society (Tiano, 1984). '
Modernization and development would lead to a replacement of the /
traditional extended family, the site of virtually all social activities,! ',. /
by the modern nuclear family, separated off from the public sphere !
of production. Within _the family there would be an increasing division

women's central role in procreation, it would be rational for them to
specialize in domestic labour, which was compatible with this role,
while men specialized in full-time production for the market. Socio
logists, such as Talcott Parsons, interpreted this division of labour in
terms of socially functional role-differentiation (see Johnson, 1989).
Women and men were socialized into personality types that fitted them

for different roles within the family. Men specialized in instrumental

roles and acquired the characteristics that went with them: rational, _,

eliminated competition between husband and wife, ensured the
proper socializati<>n of children, and allowed the family to act in
•unison in relation to the rest of the world.
However, since status was no longer based on ascribed and diffu st·
relationships, but on individual choice and achievement, women were
not necessarily disadvantaged within this system. Technological
change would reduce the scx·ial impact of biolclgical asymmetry
between men and women's physical strength and release women from
the time-consuming drudgery of housework. while birth-control
technology would give 1he1n freedom from the endless cycle of
involuntary reproduction Uaque11e, 1982. p. 269). In principle.

-
However, even women who chose not to enter the labour force would
benefit. Modernization would lead to the spread of liberal, egalitarian
values which would help to undermine old, authoritarian structures
within the family.
A great deal of early sociological research on women and develop
ment was cast in the fran1ework of modernization and sex-role theorv.
,
, It was premissed, as Jaquette ( 1982) points out, on the assumption
that
traditional societies are n1ale-do1ninated and authoritarian, and n1odern
societies are democratic and egalitarian. The proc:ess of modernization
itself, and the administration of development policies and programs, are
perceived as sex-neutral or as particularly advantageous to women. who
have been more hen,med in than men by traditional values cirrumscrihing
their roles. (p. 269)
·rhere was a proliferation of sociological studies whit·h clain1ed to
measure 'modernity' in women on the basis of changing roles and
attitudes. l"his is typified in the following quotation from a study of
n1odernity in Brazilian women:

THE THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF WID
Industrialisation encourages new attitudes and behaviour and stresses
experiences which enhance [women's] competence and feelings of self
respect, and alters their relationships with others - particularly family
members. ... Everyday experiences in city streets and in stores and shops,
sharpen their faculties and sensitize them to the importance of competence
and achievement. The opportunities for employment outside the home
enrich them intellectually as well as financially. (Rosen and La Raia, 1972, p.
354, cited in Jaquette, 1982, p. 269).
Economists who touched on the implications of development for
women offered similarly optimistic scenarios of changing roles, laying
special emphasis on the opportunities it would offer women to exercise
their rationality - the hallmark of 'economic man' - and thus to attain
full person hood. This is how Lewis, an early and influential proponent
of industrial growth for the Third World, summarized this view:
Women benefit from (growth) even more than men . . . Woman gains
freedom from drudgery, is emancipated from the seclusion of the
household, and gains at last the chance to be a full human being, exercising
her mind and her talents in the same way as men. It is open to men to debate
whether economic progress is good for men or not, but for women to
debate the desirability of economic growth is to debate whether women
should have the chance to cease to be beasts of burden, and to join the
human race. (Lewis, 1955, p. 422)1
The WID Critique of Development:
Planne.-s and Prejudice
l"he WID point of departure from this earlier intellectual tradition
stemmed from doubts over the presumed neutrality of the agencies o~
development and modernization. Contrary to early expectations; I

women had not been given access to new productive opportunities; 'i
technology had not liberated them from domestic drudgery; and
market forces had not led to gender-neutral outcomes. Prejudice an<J,
preconceptions about women persisted in society in spite of the f< ,>rce• \
of modernization.

Domtslicatio,i of Wo,ne,i: Discri"1i,u1lion i,1 l)n•elopi11K Societies ( 1980).
Boserup's analysis laid the ground"·ork for subsequent WID analy
sis. She drew att.ention to variations in sex roles across cultures and
suggested that, since women were almost always prin1arily responsible
\ for reproductive work, it was differen<·es in their productive roles that
•
! were the key variables explaining differences in their status across the
world: where women were «mfined pritnaFily to-i:eprod!_!(.:ti".'~- work.
their status was lli~.tQ.J>~Jow. In what she termed 'female farming
systems', prevailing in much of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of
Southeast Asia, won1en enjoyed 'considerable f reeclom of movement
and some economic independence' (p. 50) based on their significant
role in production. ·rhis was in n1arked contrast to the restrictions
imposed on women in the 'male farming systems' of South and West
Asia whose status was based prin1arily on their fulfilment of their
reprcxluctive roles.
The failure of mcxlernization to benefit women was attributed to a
variety of factors reflecting these different cultural contexts. In female
f arn1ing systems, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, women had been
deprived of access to training. land rights, education and technology
by colonial and post-colonial administrators whose biased perceptions
led them to favour male farmers. In the market economies of the
Third World, employers demonstrated a preference for men, creating
a sex-stereotyped job hierarchy, while women's own prejudices and
J
preferences inhibited them from seeking employment in the modern
sector. "fhis led to a divergence in attitudes. since •t:mployment in the
modern sect<>r requires not only formal training. but also a certain
attitude to work which may best be described as the capacity to work
regularly and attentively .... l'hose who work within the confines of
the f an1ily are not likely to acquire this attitude' (p. 214 ). Boserup thus

subscribed to the basic elements of the modernization model, but
attacked its failure to deliver the goods to women in the Third World.
The modern economy being promoted by development planners had
brought new resources and opportunities to men, but left women on
the margins of development. Consequently, 'the productivity, attitude
and oullook of men and women begin to diverge, just as we found
happening when commercial farming replaced subsistence agricul
ture; men become familiar with modern equipment and learn to adapt
themselves to modern ways of life, while women continue in the old
ways' (p. 139).
Boserup's final chapter, 'The Design of Female Education', con
tained her main recommendations for policy. She pointed out that
'women's way to employment in the modern sector is barred not only
by women's prejudices, but also by their lack of proper qualifications'
(p. 212). She condemned the tendency of planners to see women as
'secondary' earners and to train them to be more efficient housewives
rather than seeking to improve their professional ability to compete
equally with men in the marketplace. She concluded by calling for
better-designed education for women to enhance their competitive
ness and productivity in the economy.
A similar focus on misinformation and prejudice in the planning
process is found in Tinker ( 1976). She suggested that 'Western
stereotypes of appropriate roles and occupations tended to be
exported with aid' (p. 33) so that modernization continuously widened
the gap between the ability of men and women to cope with the
modern world. The problem stemmed from the Western glorification
of women's child-bearing roles and the concomitant downgrading of
the economic functions associated with child care and housewoµ....,
These attitudes were then disseminated throughout the world:
'Accepting this stereotype of women's roles, economic theorists in th
West imbued their students, indigenous and foreign, with the clich
that "women's place is in the home" classifying them forever a
economically dependent' (p. 22).
A major consequence of these stereotypes was the invisibility of
women's productive roles in the planning process: 'planners, generally
men - whether in donor-country agencies or in recipient countries -
have been unable to deal with the fact that women must perform two
roles in society, while men perform only one' (p. 22). Planners, Tinker
suggested, needed to rethink the 'mythical stereotypes' which led
labour-force statistics to be defined only in terms of work performed
for money and work located in the modern sector. The definition of _.
work had to include subsistence labour, child care and work in the
teniary and informal sectors, otherwise development would continue

However, while it was clear that ·rinker laid the blan1e for develop

The question raised by her analysis is whether <>rganizations which

From Welfare to Efficiency: WID Achievements in
the Policy Domain
The efforts of WID advocates and scholars led to some important
and enduring shifts in the way in which policymakers viewed women's
role in the development process and in the policies that resulted.
Soc~jcal sex-role theory had been an important componenLof
modernization_.theol:¥·-and had taken firnrtooljn.Lhc mi11dsc1 of the·
deV(:J.op.mcnLcommunity. It accounted for the particular model of the
household (a nuclear family consisting of a male breadwinne~
dependent housewife and children) which underpinned most devell
opment interventions. Feminists had already begun to subvert ortho
dox interpretations of sex roles, no longer viewing them as an·
expression of social complementarity, but rather as an aspect of
women's inferior status in society (Eisenstein, 1984). Sex-role socializa
tion was seen as a key factor in curtailing women·s potential. shaping
their attitudes, prefe1·enccs and expectations. It enforced their
conformity to the 'expressive' role wi1hin the family, one which

with the an1bition, achievement and hnan<:ial rc\\·ar<ls associated \\'ith

!'i ·o this challenge, Wll) scholars added their own critique, pointing
!to the n1align inHuence of sex-role theory in the p<>licy process,

·. iy~_Jal><>ur. Empirical evidenre of the ren1arkable diversity in the
gender division of lab<>ur across the world was used by WI D advocates
t<> challenge the idea that the n1ale breadwinner/fernale dependent
division of roles was son1ehow 'naturally given·. and helped to shift the
thinking around roles fro1n biological explanati<>ns to cultural ones.
Boserup herself argued str<>ngly against any atte1npt to rnake uni
versal or biological generalizations about the division of labour.
pointing out that, 'while the mernhers of any given community may
think that their particular division of labour between the sexes is the
"naturar· one, ... other cornn1unities n1ay have completely different
ways of dividing the burden of work among the sexes, and they too
rnay hnd their ways just as "natural"'· (p. 15 ). Rogers incorporated the
distinction en1erging in the social sciences between sex as 'physical
<listinction· and gender as 's<>eial and cultural' explicitly into her
analysis in order to attack the biologistic explanations of sex r<>les
\vhich underpinned so much of developn1ent planning:

·rhe imprint of sex-role stereotypes on the data-collection practices
<>f development agencies had played a powerful role in defining
won1en as housewives, regardless of the local reality. One imponant
j c<>nsequence of WID's challenge to the universality of the nuclear

the Third World. This has resulted in more systematic disaggregation
in data-collection efforts within national and international agencies so
that the empirical base for planning is now far more refined. More
significantly, however, WID advocacy shifted the grounds for invest
ing development resources in women from welfare to efficiency or, as
Jaquette put it ( 1990), from need to merit. At a time when women had
been primarily associated with the welfare sector in the planning
process, WID advocates used efficiency-based arguments for rescuing
women from the margins of development and integrating them into
the mainstream. Boserup spoke directly to a market conception of
merit claims. She accepted the fundamental wisdom of the market
model, but argued that policies based on Western notions of women's
roles had 'hobbled' potentially efficient producers (Jaquette, 1990). In
contrast to appeals based on women's neediness which could be
effective but were likely to be short-lived and subject to the arbitrary
whims of charity and political expediency, the shift to merit and
efficiency as the basis for women's equality in development promised a
more resilient basis for WID advocacy.
The efficiency argument was clearly spelt out by Rogers, who
hammered home Boserup's message of women as rational economic
agents, constrained by discriminatory planning processes. However,
Rogers' book, published in 1980, a decade after Boserup's, contained
an interesting reversal in the argument connecting women and
development. While earlier arguments had stressed the 'adverse
impact of development on women', Rogers stressed the adverse impact
of women's exclusion on development. In view of the growing
economic crisis in the Third World, she suggested that continued
neglect of women's productivity was a costly mistake that planners

Tfie'shifts in policy discourse effected by WID advocacy is evident in
the strategy documents of some of the major development agencies.
We noted some examples of this in Chapter l in relation to the UN
Decade declarations. A recent review of Nordic donor agencies also
draws attention to the shift from the persistent linking of women and
welfare in the policy docun1ents of the early period of Nordic
development assistance to its current emphasis on an 'integrated

development assistance be it related to the project cycle or adminis
tration· (Lexow, 1988, p. 11 ). A p<>Sition paper brought out by the
World Bank at the end of the seventies echoes these concerns. It, too.
makes a strong case of integrating women into development on
grounds of economic efficiency: 'If women continue to be left out of
the mainstream of development and deprived of opportunities to
realise their full potential, serious inefficiencies in the use of resour(:es
will persist' ( 1979, p. l ).
The efficiency argument for WID is n1ost clearly spelt out in the
USAID document Wom,n i11 Del'rlopmeru Aid Poliry (1982). 'fhe
· ocument declares unequivocally that, ··rhe experience of the past I 0
ears tells us that the key issue underlying the won1en in devel<>pment
·oncepl is an trl'fl!_om~n1y en1phasis). ·rhe theme of women as
1
· rational agents, responsive to incentives and ill-served by past assump
tions of passive dependency, is seen as a m~jor rationale for gender
sensitivity in the planning process: 'Knowledge of these gender-role
patterns will assist project planners to n1axin1ise the chance of project
success. ... Incentives for change which are specifically adapted to
gender roles. and are therefore based on a proper assessment of the
stake the p<>pulation feels in the outcorne of the project, is critical to
success.' Wll) advocacy has thus helped to dislodge the earlier
equation between women and welfare, and placed women and
efficiency firmly <>n the developn1ent agenda - at a time when the
concern with efficiency was once again in the ascendant among the
n1ajor international donors. In practice, however, the neo-liberal
interpretation of efficiency is often at odds with some of the goals of
WID advocacy. 1·he new policy stress on won1en's econornic agency has
occurred at a time when major cutbacks in public expenditure as a part
of structural adjusunent programmes were leading to the shifting of
responsibility for welfare services from the paid to the unpaid
economy, often through the intensification of women's labour (Elson,
1991 a). ·rhe recognition of women's productive potential appears to
have been achieved al the expense of appreciation for their unpaid
,-~r~kload within the household.
The juxtaposition of the neo-liberal agenda of market-led efficiency
with the WID emphasis on wornen as economic agents has served to

Jagger ( 1983) has pointed to the 'normative dualism' embedded in
this concept of the human being, in that the mind is seen as separate
from, and higher than, the body because it is the site of what is
essentially human. A series of binary oppositions flowing from this
framework is repeated throughout liberal thought (mind/body, cul
ture/nature, mentaUmanual, rationaUinstinctual) and permeates the
ways in which value is given to labour, creativity and effort. Human
effort that requires the exercise of intellectual fa cuities is given
precedence over manual labour; work that is guided by instrumental
ist criteria is given precedence over affective labour. It is the claim of
liberal theory- that-ait···merr-are ·equal .because they possess. this
essentially human ability to reason. Liberal feminists extended this
claim women on -the grounds that they, too, are rational.

marginalization of women in the development process served to
disguise and deny material differences in power, resources and
interests between women themselves. It privileged a particular
interpretation of women's needs and interests over others which might

particular from Third World feminists. In their examination of
Boserup's work, Beneria and Sen ( 1981) challenged her basically
benevolent view of modernization and her neglect of the systemic
interconnections between social processes of capital accumulation,
class formation and the changing situation of women. In the light of
these broader processes of inequality, they described the idea that
women's declining status could be halted by better education and
training as 'treating cancer with bandaid'. Boserup's policy conclusions
were all the more paradoxical as she explicitly acknowledged the large
numbers of educated unemployed men in l"hird World cities who had
not been absorbed into the modern labour force. She had also dealt at
some length with the sex segmentation in the modern sector which

The indifference displayed by many WID advocates to the interlock

in the reformability of a market-led development process were also
challenged by Bandarage. She attributed their optimism to the
fundamental belief that women's p<>verty and subordination were
'simply aberrations within an otherwise just and equitable social
systen1', the results of 'traditional values and male ignorance', rather
than 'a structural feature of a social system which puts the profits of a
few before the human needs of the many' (p. 499). Her conclusion was
that the solutions needed were political rather than merely technical.
DAWN, a network of activists. policymakers and researchers from
the Third World, suggested that the problems of development were
not unique to the ·rhird World (Sen and Grown, 1985). Within !he

men: 'Equality with men who themselves suffered unemployment, low
wages, poor work conditions and racism within the existing socio
econon1ic structures did not seem an adequate or worthy goal' (p. 18).
As DAWN pc>inted out. many ·rhird World women were caught
between their reluctance to separate the struggle against women's
subordination from other struggles against poverty, apartheid and
neo-colonialism, on the one hand, and their unwillingness to com
promise the struggle against women's subordination or to relegate it to
some distant future, on the other. (;iven the very different positioning

AAWORD, a network of African researchers. l'hey rejected the

tions with various representatives of international agencies recorded
by Rogers ( 1980, p. 55) suggests how this might happen:

Rogers suggests that alerting planners to suchom1ssions might

persuade them to take then1 into account in future efforts. However,
the idea that better information would result in more enlightened
planning was treated with scepticism by AAWORD, which asked: 'Is
local recognition of women's vital role in production and reproduc
tion, followed by proper planning, sufficient precondition to solving
the n1ultifaceted problems women face?' (p. 106).
Judging from analysis contributed by Dixon ( I 985), the answer
appears to be no, it is not enough. Dixon pointed out that, while

definitional and procedural biases had generally led to the invisibility
of women's contributions in national statistics, this was not the case in
sub-Saharan Africa. Here the agriculture contributions of women
farmers had long been documented in labour-force statistics, possibly
because independent female farming in the region meant that women
farmers were classified as 'self-employed cultivators' rather than
'unpaid family helpers'; possibly because African women often sold
their own produce - 'where money is involved, interviewers take
notice' (p. 28); or possibly because the temporary or long-term absence
of working-age men from some of these regions led interviewers to
talk directly to women. Nevertheless, the visibility of women's eco
nomic contributions in statistical data had not been matched by a
corresponding visibility in the distribution of development resources
such as land, livestock, transport, capital equipment, credit, info rma
tion and training. Dixon concluded:
It is the blindness to these inequities more than the blindness of invisibility
that stands in women's way. The blindness has an institutional and political
base. One cannot help concluding that the real issue is who controls the
resources distributed to, and deriving from, agricultural households. The
reluctance to 'see' women farmers comes not from their invisibility, but
from a reluctance to share scarce resources with them. Land, labor,
livestock, capital, technology. information, training - aJI are valued goods
that imbue those who own or control them with power and prestige. Why
should these resources be shared? Why should institutions be restructured,
power bases challenged? (p. 32)

Thus the principal maker·s-and. . iinplementors of policy, printarily
men from the elite groups of their societies, do not generally live in
intimate power relationship with the poor, with minority groups, or
with those whose environments are threatened. The fact that they
often live with women leads them to believe that they can generalize
from their own experiences: as Lipman-Blum observes, the men who
make policies around the world 'have complete faith in their own
understanding of women's natures and roles' ( 1979, p. 6. cited in
Staudt, 1985). It also gives them a very personal stake in the existing
ideas and practices through which they have acquired their gender
identities, and therefore in the outcomes of policies which threaten
these ideas and practices. Rogers ( 1980) noted this earlier on in her
encounter with development officials:
One of the mosl consistent responses of n1ale planners lo the introduction
of discussion about women in development is to base their arguments
against change on the domestic model fan1iliar to them: 'my wife doesn't
work', 'I get on very well with my daughters', 'my mother always said a
woman's place is in the home' and other variations on the theme that all
women should follow the model of feminine deportment which they
consider correct. (p. 50)

very absurdity brings home the contrast between 'the stryctural and
situational perspective used for race and class, on the one hand, and
the individualized, essentialist view inherent in the sex roles approach
on the <>ther' (Ferree and Hess, 1987, p. 15). Retrospective evaluations
<>f the early WID contribution to developn1ent thought and practice
have helped both WID advocates and others working in the develop
ment field to identify the component missing in the early analysis: the
significance of male power as an integral aspect of women's subordina
tion and the need therefore to envisage the WID agenda as a political
process.
However. critiques of WID go beyond its neglect of gender politics
in the policy domain; they question its theoretical ability and political
willingness to address the systemic nature of gender inequality and its
connection with other forms of inequality thrown up by the function
ing of an asymmetrical world economy. The acceptance by WID
advocates of the existing model of development associates them with a
particular world-view whose hegemonic slat us within the development
field permits it to be presented as a universally valid and non
ideological agenda. More accurate data may assist in improving
planning procedures, but will not bring about the radical revisions that
are necessary. Support for WID advocacy within the official agencies
of development should not therefore be divorced from a broader
political process of transforming these agencies into more account
able, transparent and democratic structures.

Marxism and the Human Individual
Marxisn1 views human beings as one species among others, with
biological needs ~hich, like those of anirnals, are satisfiecl in the
tn'lural world, lfurnan beings began to distinguish then1selves f ron1
: animals with the first act of pruduci11g their ,neans of subsistence rather
( than simply utiliz.i11g what existed in natural form. By acting on the
· external world and changing it, hurnan beings also changed them-
selves and their relationship to the external world, thereby marking an
increasing differentiation between thernselves and other biological
species. Unlike the activity of anin1als, human labour - or praxis - is
reflexive and purposeful; what distinguishes the most clumsy human
activities from the rnost ingenious anin1al ones is that 'at the end of
every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the
imagination of the labourer at its comn1encement' (Marx, 1970, p.
174). ln this view of the hurnan, there is no separation between mind
and bc>dy; human labour, in the Marxist sense, is purposeful a1ul
reflective actit ity rather than blind instinct. on one hand, or the product
1
of a disembodied rationality, on the other.
,
Recognizing that hurnan biolc>gy necessitates some level of interde
pendence between individuals, Marxism sees human labour as essen
tially social. ·rhe human essence is not some abstract quality inherent
in each individual; rather, it is constituted through the 'ensemble of
social relations' within which people find themselves in specific

historical contexts. The social relations which human individuals form
with each other help to organize their activities and to pattern specific
modes of production. Human labour is initially directed towards
satisfying basic survival needs, but in the process it both produces the
means to satisfy human needs and creates new ones. Human beings
move beyond biological survival through this dialectical interaction
between biological need, human cooperation and the natural environ
ment, interactions which are brought about by human praxis. Since
these interactions are subject to historical change, human beings and
human consciousness are themselves products of history. In place,
therefore, of the liberal view of the human individual existing prior to
history, Marxist analysis treats human beings as products of complex,
ongoing and interactive processes through which historically consti
tuted needs are met.

In later history, the emergence of a generalized market economy,
the distinguishing feature of the capitalist mode of production, led to a
cleavage between the production of commmodities, which was shifted
to the public sphere of the marketplace, and production of human life
and labour, which continued in the private sphere of the home.
Monogamy remained indispensable to class society since it was one of
the main institutional supports of private property. Its persistence
prevented women from participating in public life fully and thereby
shedding their dependent status. However, there was now an import
ant difference between working-class women and those from the
capitalist class. Working-class families had no private wealth to pass on,
so that working-class women had fewer constraints and more incent
ives to enter the labour force. Early Marxists predicted that working
class women (and children) would in fact enter industry in la~r..,.._----..
numbers. As workers, they would be freed from the oppression of
their dependent f amity status and subject only to the same exploitative
process as working-class men. Thus the entry of women into the public
arena of production would serve both to end their oppression as
women and build their solidarity with working-class men. In reality,
however, the large-scale entry of women into public production did
not occur in much of the capitalist world, and where women entered

Dependency Feminism and the Needs of Capital
An example of a traditional Marxist feminist perspective on develop

In a paradigmatic exposition of these ideas, Saffiotti ( 1977) argued
that women's situation resulted from two intersecting contradictions:
'the contradiction between social classes, which is dominant in capital
ist social formations, and the contradiction between sexes, which is
subordinate in the same type of social formation' (p. 28). Sexual
division reflected the legislation and social prejudices of specific
societies, which were also divided by class. Class, however, was the
fundamental contradiction, since only class antagonism possessed the
structural conditions for surpassing the limits of the system. Drawing
on Rosa Luxemburg's thesis that pre-capitalist forms of production
provided an essential subsidy to capital accumulation, Saffiotti sug
gested that the family was a primary example of a pre-capitalist form
which performed this function. The services carried out within the
family, mainly by women, reproduced the commodity, labour power,
on a daily and a generational basis. Despite the indispensability of this
'labour rent' to the process of capital accumulation, these services did
not assume a capitalist, that is, contractual, form. Rather, the work
relations within the family were distinctly domestic ones, remnants of
an earlier organizational form in which production was geared to the
daily needs of household members. Labour power continued to be
produced through these 'pre-capitalist' personalized relations, which
were characterized by their voluntaristic nature and the absence of any
explicit contracts regulating the distribution of domestic duties, the
working time devoted to each of them, or the remuneration of these
2
services.

conlradi<:tions over those of gender within this framework was critical
to its contention that women and n1en shared common class interests:
'It is not men who keep won1en al home - though they may appear to
be the mosl direct oppressors - but the structure of the capitalist
system, which benefits f r<)tn the unpaid lab<>r of housewives or, in
wartime, draws upon this reserve lab<>r supply' (Nash and Safa, 1980.
p. xi). However, once dependency feminists moved from the abstract
to the empirical, they were cc>nfr onted with aspects of social life which
could be overl<><>ked on the theoretical plane. l ' he dependent position
of women within the family and the active role played by their men in
perpetuating this dependence raisect questions about the extent to
which women's status could be attributed entirely to the needs of
capital.
·ro explain this phenomenon without undermining their political
priorities, dependency feminists pointed lo the pervasiveness of a
patriarchal sex-role ideology within the Latin American family at all
· · s levels 'Such ideology n1aintained that women's place was in the
home that she musl defer lo her husband in all matters relating to
'·. the world outside the home. (Nash and Safa, 1980. p. 25). l:be family

large and their dependent situation withjn the family.
If many women tended to perceive their husbands, rather than
capitalists, as their oppressors, it was because their distance from
: capitalist relations had denied them the opportunity to develop class
consciousness. Thus, researching working-class households in Puerto
Rico, Safa found that the 'abuse suffered by many women at the hands
of their husbands makes them feel far more oppressed by men and
marriage than by their class position. Nearly three-quarters of the
women interviewed in 1959 felt that most marriages are unhappy, and
· lamed it on the man and his vices' (Safa, 1980, p. 78). However, she
/ uggested that it was difficult for women to realize that what they were
xperiencing was a result of working-class men's inability to take out
e frustration and hostility they felt towards tedious, unrewarding
jobs except on women and children, w_ho were tbeir only &ulx)rdinales.
'What women feel most directly is the man as the oppressor, and
j therefore much of their own hostility is directed against men rather
,,than against the class system' (p. 78). She argued that, despite this
sexual antagonism, there was considerable female solidarity among

working-class households. They were the mainstay of the family,
providing a haven in a heartless world for working-class men:
though men and women are alienated in their work roles, they have a
domestic sphere to which they can retreat and which capitalism has as yet
been unable to destroy .... This is particularly important to the working
class, who have no other source of identity, and who are subjected to
extreme exploitation in their relationships with other classes in the
metropolis, which are governed by status and market relationships. (p. 80)
Dependency feminists thus offered a very different account of :-

detachment of information and attitudes from underlying economic
structures and power relationships (Elliot, 1977), dependency femin
ists uncovered the systematic connections between different forms of

itrequalities at international, national and household levels. Moreover,
b.)L.aiialysing women's domestic labour as a subsidy to the process of
capit~.l _accumulation, they challenged the boundaries of traditional
MacxisJ analysis which located women pri1narily in the private sphere
and ther efo re as irrelevant to the workings of capital.
However, the strong affiliation demonstrated by many dependency
feminists to a traditional Marxist politics limited the analytical scope of

Mies suggested that the rise of patriarchy could be traced to man
the-hunter's original control over the tools of destruction. What
Engels had failed to grasp in his account of pre-patriarchal society was
the s<>cial significance of the fact that women and men acted upon their

STRUCTURALIST PERSPECTIVES
natural environment with qualitatively different bodies. Women, as
bearers of children and carers of the family, experienced their entire
bodies as productive, not simply their arms and legs, head and hands,
and consequently enjoyed a harmonious relationship between the
nature of their bodies and the nature of their environment. Men,
however, unable to produce through their bodies, were forced to rely
on tools in order to make their productive contributions. However,
men's hunting tools were basically means of destruction (rather than
production, as Engels suggested) capable of killing humans as well as
animals. The full exploitative potential of their control of the means of
destruction became apparent with the development of livestock and
agriculture and the emergence of an economic surplus. In the struggle
to appropriate the surplus for themselves, men's control over the tools
of destruction allowed them to domesticate women, as well as animals,
and to restrict them to the role of breeding children, particularly sons
to inherit their wealth. Women became defined as nature, as part of
the physical preconditions for male production. The predatory
relationship between man and nature became the model for organiz
ing his relationship with women. This predatory mode of production,
according to Mies, has underpinned all subsequent developments. Its
latest manifestation, capitalism, has been built on the interrelated
processes of colonization and housewifization, both entailing the
consignment of large sections of humanity to the realm of nature and
therefore to justified exploitation. The 'man-the-hunter' model which
gave rise to the original predatory mode of production continues to be
the 'base and last resort' of all subsequent modes of production.
It is clear that while Mies uses many Marxist concepts, she
unequivocally rejects what she deems the 'old scientific socialist
argument' that women's oppression was a secondary contradiction and
belonged in the sphere of ideology and superstructure. Where
traditional Marxist feminists had shied away from the idea that men
might benefit from women's oppression as mm, rather than as
members of the ruling class, Mies declared unequivocally that the
'male-female relation' was fundamentally a relationship of power. In
foregrounding male violence as the key to understanding women's
oppression, her account represented a radical departure from what
has been described as 'the traditional Marxist ploy' of removing the
agents of domination from the scene, leaving behind only the blind
workings of the capitalist system to explain women's oppression
(Campioni and Grosz, 1991). Furthermore, her focus on the sexually
differentiated body as an important site for the enactment of
patriarchal power relations opened up the analysis of women's
oppression to a whole range of issues around body politics that

fc1ninists ha<l becn working with, but that traditional l\farxists had
chosen to ignore or play down.
In the en<l, however, Mies·s bold atte1npl to break from the
econ<)n1ic detern1inism of traditional Marxisrn suffers from the same
problen1s which beset n1osl accounts that attempt lo trace current
s<>cial phenon1ena to their rcx1t rause in the origins of history. Mies
argues that the attempt to unrover the origins of women's oppression
is critical lo a ferninisl political strategy: if patriarchy had a beginning.
it must have an end. An alternative reading of the quest for origins is
put forward by Rosaldo: ··ro l1)(1k for origins is, in the end, to think that
what we are tod ay is son1ething other than the product of our histo~'
and our present s<>cial world. and, n1ore particularly, that our gender
systen1s are pron1ordial. transhistorical, and essentially unchanging in
their r0<,ts' ( 1980, p. 392). Or. as (:onnell puts it, the problem with the
claim that knowledge of the origins of patriarchy can inform current
oppositional strategies is that it assun1es that 'nothing much changes
ajtrr the Origin. Like the Elephant's (:hild in the Just So Stories having
its nose stretched, once you get it you are stuck with it' (Connell, 1987.
p. 146). And indeed the in1pression that emerges from Mies's account
is that, despite changes in the n1odes of production, patriarchy
ren1ains much the san1e. All of history is presented as a catalogue of the
various atrocities con1mitted against wornen. From the earliest prac
tices of kidnapping, raping and imprisoning them in harems, to the
hunting. torture and burning of thousands of women as witches in
medieval Europe, to the enslavement of the ·rhird World and the rape
of nature, n1en have shaped history in their own violent image. Today
the catalogue of violence against won1en continues in the form of wife
battering, rape, sexual trafficking, fen1ale circumcision, population
control as 'gynocide', dowry murders, female foeticide: 'violence
against women, therefore, seen1s the main common denominator that
epitomizes women's exploit.ation and oppression, irrespective of class,
nation, caste, race, capitalist or socialist systems, 'I'hird World or First
World' (p. 169).
Mies makes sweeping use of monolithic categories such as the global
patriarchy, the 'BIG, WHl'fE MEN', 'women' and 'the colonies'
without ever pausing to disaggregate these categories and question the
extent to which they are always internally coherent. T his allows her to
sidestep the potential contradictions in her account. For instance, it
allows her to avoid giving the same degree of attention to the role
played by women themselves, or by men from the colonies, in
perpetuating the oppression of women. Where men's violence against
men rather than wornen is touched on, as in her discussion of
imperialisn1 and slavery, it is laid at the dc>0r of the BIG WHIT£ MEN.

those who currently control the technology of destruction. Where this
viole11ce is perpetrated by Third World men against Third World
women, she suggests that this is an imitation effect or what she calls 'the
BIG MEN- little men syndrome': 'They imitate the Big White Men in
the West who are their model of a modern man .... Those who have
money can buy all those things the BIG Men have, including women.
Those who do not have enough money still have the same dreams' (p.
167). Where it is women who are implicated in violence against
women - as is often the case with dowry murders in India and female
circumcision in parts of Africa - Mies is silent. Her overriding
emphasis on the power of men, and the BIG WHITE MEN in
particular, denies women any historical agency al all. All men appear
as monsters, their culpability in inverse proportion to their location in
the global patriarchal hierarchy; all women appear as their victims.

An important contribution to the project of building this less
monolithic framework of analysis was made by the Subordination of
Women (SOW)...Group (see IDS, 1979). Along with an unease with
global generalizations about the effects of capitalism and the
patriarchy on women, the SOW group were also dissatisfied with the
promotion of 'women· as the key category of analysis in the WID
discourse. The consequent treatn1ent of women and men as isolable
categories had helped to render invisible men's roles in the continuing
subordination of women in the development process. The challenge
f<>r SOW was to steer a path somewhere between the liberal individual
ism of WID scholarship and the structural determinism of certain
Marxist accounts, so that analysis could move beyond demonstrating
the adverse/marginalizing impact of development/capitalism on
women to a deeper understanding of the ways in which unequal
relations between women and n1en may have contributed to the extent
and forms of exclusion that won1en faced in the development process.

useful place to begin a discussion of what is meant by gender relations
is with the following quotation from Marx, cited in Rubin ( 1975,
p. 158):
What is a Negro slave? A man of the black race. The one explanation is as
good as the other. A Negro is a Negro. He only becomes a slave in certain
relations. A cotton spinning jenny is a machine for spinning cotton. It
becomes capital only in certain relations. Torn from these relationships, it is
no more capital than gold itself is money or sugar is the price of sugar.
The quotation graphically illustrates a profound insight in Marxist
thought - the significance of social relations in ascribing a meaning
and a place to people and things - but also its profound limitations. As
Rubin points out, 'in Marx's map of the social world, human beings are
workers, peasants, or capitalists; that they are also men and women is
not seen as very significant' (p. 160). However, the idea of social
relations can be usefully extended to the analysis of women's con
dition, as Rubin demonstrated in her paraphrase of Marx:
What is a domesticated woman? A female of the species. The one
explanation is as good as the other. A won1an is a woman. She only becomes
a domestic, a wife, a chattel, a playboy bunny, a prostitute, or a human
dictaphone in certain relations. Torn from these relationships, she is no
more the helpmate of man than gold in itself is money ... etc. (p. 158)

Gender relations (in this quotation) can be seen as the full ensemble of \
social relationships through which the female of the human speci
becomes the 'domesticated woman'.. 'he distinction etw n sex and
gender, referred to in Chapter 3, is further elaborated by Rubin. As
she points out, the male and female of the human species are

They are·distinguished -from each other only by a small range of
biological differences: 'from the standpoint of nature, men and
women are closer to each other than either is to anything else - for
instance, mountains, kangaroos, or coconut palms ... the idea that
men and women are two mutually exclusive categories n1ust arise out
of something other than a non-existent ''.natu.ral'.'...op1ro5irton~"(Rubin,
1975, p. 178). Thus, while sexually differentiated bodies can seen as an

inequalities. A social-relations approach, therefore, does not give
priority to either class or gender as the determining principle of
individual identity or social position. Rather, as Beneria and Sen
( 1982) put it:
First, a woman's class position structures the concrete meaning of gender
for her. The variations that exist between women of different classes are at
least as important for the woman's social position as the commonalities
inherent in being a women within a given society. Second, class defines the
relations among women themselves. That is, class is not simply a differen
tiating mechanism that places women in varying social boxes. It is an
antagonistic social relation that defines, for example, the oppressive social
relation between female domestic servants and their mistresses. Class is also
antagonistic in broader terms ... women of different classes often have
opposing interests in social organizations and programs for social change.
(p. 162)
The Ascribed Relations of Gender
A key set of relations which structure gender both as individual
identity as well as social inequality are those of kinship and family, the
'relations of everyday life'. In pre-capitalist societies, kinship was the
key idiom of social interaction, organizing economic, cultural and
political activities as well as sexual and reproductive practice. Clearly,
in such contexts, the domestic domain was the primary site of most
social relations, including those of gender. By contrast, one of the
pivotal features of contemporary market-based societies has been the
instituiionalized separation of the 'private' domain of family and
kinship from other more 'public' institutions of the market and state.
The familial domain still remains a critical site of gender relations in
capitalist society, but has ramifications that reach deep into the
apparently separate public arena.

this literature comes primarily from Europe and North America
(Chodorow, 1978; Rubin, 1975; Dinnerstein, 1977), there is no reason
why familial arrangements should not have an important inAuence on
individual identities in other cultures as well. Kakar's study in India,
for instance, points out how the closeness of the mother-son bond in
the Indian family creates an unconscious fear of women's strength in

rnen ( 1978, cited in Chambers. 1990). Such analysis emphasizes the
deep-rootedness of gender identities in people's sense of their place in
the world, and the consequent unease which is unleashed by any
attempt to question, let alone change. the ideological underpinnings
and social arrangernents of the family.
Along with individual gender identities. family and kinship relations
are systems for organizing rights, responsibilities and resources for
different categories of members indifferent social groups. Whitehead
characterizes relationships within the familial domain as gender
ascriptive: 'in them, to describe the position is to describe the gender'
(Whitehead, 1979. p. 11 ). Thus to be a husband, a wife, a mother. a
father, uncle, niece, and so forth, is to be either a n1an or a woman.''
These relationships are governed by social 'rules' which determine
how assets are to be distributed between the occupants of the different
relationships. how authority and status are to be assigned, and how
labour allocated. Familial relationships are a primary mechanism
through which social n1eanings are invested in, and social controls
exercised over, womens' bodies, labour, sexuality, reproductive capa
city and life choices. Although varying across different classes and
s<>cial groupings. the rules and practices governing marriage, procre
ation, inheritance and parenting all combine to ensure that, in much of
the world, the care and nurture of the family is seen as primarily
won1en 's responsibility. while entitlen1ent to n1aterial resources is
n1ainly invested in men - hence the 'n1onotonous similarity' of
women's oppression in different parts of the world. On the other
hand, the rules and practices through which familial relations are
C<>nstructed, and the scope that they give to women to challenge.
negotiate and transform them. are 'endlessly variable', taking different
forms over time and in different settings. Instead of positing a
universal structure of patriarchy, a social-relations approach suggests
that apparent commonalities in gender subordination across the
world are constructed through historically specific class and gender
relations, and consequently have very different implications for what
n1en and women can and cann<>t do.

•
labour in feminist analysis of different institutions is not unexpected. '
The feminist reworking of this concept offers a powerful tool for
analysing the complexity, the pervasiveness and the deep-rootedness
of gender as a facet of human endeavour.
At its simplest, the gender division of labour can be seen as the
allocation of particular tasks to particular people. It becomes a social
structure to the extent that this allocation poses a constraint on
further practice (Connell, 1987). This happens in a number of
interrelated ways. Prior divisions of labour become sedimented
through practice so that they take on the significance of social rules: in
most cultures, women look after children because they have 'always'

effon that goes into prmecting gender hierarchies in the division of

struggles over definitions of qualifications and skills, 1raining, wage
differentials and occupational grading 1hrough which the more
privileged sections of the male working class have defended their
privileges within national and international labour markets.

Gender Relations and the Development Process
·--
1n the context of development studies, a gender-relations framework
seeks to establish an i,nductive mode of analysis in _.R!_a.£.~ of highly

/ izations: 'The form that gendes; .-eJac.ions take in an.y bisrorical
!i situati~n is specific. to th.&l situ.&tion and has to be constructed
inductively; it cannot be r.ead off from other social relation~ nor from
p.
the gender relations of other societies' (Young et al., 1981, vii). As a
1
general pr<~ject, this perspective has been associated with the study of
the variable, sometimes contradictory, outcomes of the interaction
between specific forms of gender subordination and different pro
cesses of production. Whether pitched at the level of larger structures
or located in more micro-level realities, a social-relations approach is
concerned with exploring how the relations of class and gender
mediate social realities, translating broader processes of change into
concrete gains and losses for different groups of women and men. Nor
is change seen as unidirectional. While the drive for capital accumula
tion does impose a powerful logic on the possibilities open to
individuals and groups. the diverse ways in which people organize
their working and fan1ily lives also exercise upward pressures on the
capacity of global capitalism to shape these possibilities. 1~he con
sequences can be seen in the multiplicity of outcomes that emerge

Beneria and Sen ( 1982) provide an example of a macro-structural
analysis of gender relations within the international workings of
capital. -rhey point out that the single most powerful tendency of
capital accumulation is to separate direct producers from the means of
production and make their conditions of survival n1ore insecure and
contingent. However, capitalism is not seen as a single homogenous
structure of surplus extraction, but rather as different regimes of

accumulation which employ 'qualitatively different' mechanisms of
exploitation in plantation economies, small-holder commercial farms,
labour-intensive or capital-intensive industries, export-oriented or
inward-looking growth. Its implications for the gender division of
labour and for women's subordination will depend, therefore, on the
specific forms that accumulation takes in different social formations.
Such analysis points to the inadequacy of the WID view that women
were adversely affected by development because of unequal access to
new technologies and skills. It suggests, rather, that technical change
was itself embedded in changing class relations of production. It was
accompanied by the alienation of the mass of direct producers, both
women and men, from the means of production and by their growing
reliance on the sale of labour power, large-scale migration in search of
work and the resultant growth of unemployment in the urban slums.
The authors conclude that the problem was not that women had not
been integrated into development, but that they had been integrated
at the bottom of an inherently hierarchicial and contradictory struc
ture of production and accumulation. While apparently widespread,
this outcome reflected differing configurations of accumulation
regimes, processes of class formation , and gender relations. Some of
the factors behind women's subordinate position were related to
gender; others reflected specific patterns of capital accumulation and
the forms of inequality which they systematically created or exacer
bated. For poorer women, the results might be overwork and
undernourishment, even in relation to men of their class. For
wealthier women, concentration on reproductive work might free
them from direct class-based exploitation, but generally meant greater
economic dependence on men. ~ --

Also from a gender relations perspective, Kandiyoti's analysis ( 1985)
focuses on the interaction between different forms of household
organization and economic transforn1ation in different parts of the
w<>rld. She suggests that the spread of capitalist relations of production
represents the combined and uneven workings of national govern
n1ents. internati<>nal agencies and muhinatic>nal corporations- 'fhe so
called 'traditional' sector, the target of the n1odernization project, is in
most cases the product of highly 'n1odern' interventions. It reflects the
distorti<>ns wrought by colonial penetrations of the economies, and the
cc>ercion of peasants into prc>ducing cash crops on smallholder farms
or in plantations. A con1parison of rural cornm<><litization processes in
different regions <>f the world suggests that production relations
between the sexes, prior to capitalist incorporation, both shaped the
subsequent division of labour and 'set limits' to its variability. The
interests of capital in cheap and plentiful labour were not necessarily
in harmony with the survival strategies adopted by individual house
h<>lcl units, or with the division of lab<>ur and power within them.
Resistance at the household level could thwart the smooth operation of
capital accumulation.
At a still lower level of analysis, W~iteheacl)( 1981) provides a
<letailed account <>f the intra-h<>usehold-dtvision of labour and
resources between men and won1cn in the very different economic
systems of rw:a)_ (~hana and industria-l -B-ritain. In one context,
households relied on subsistence-prr.itfiiction; in the other, they relied
on the sale of labour power and the p_urchase of wage goods.

challenge the notion that women and men are somehow naturally
suited to certain tasks and activities. Wornen's ability to pursue their
claims within the policy process has been closely bound up with
pushing back the boundaries of what is 'natural' about their lives and
revealing its socially constructed basis. Furthermore, understanding
how deeply gender identities are rooted in our consciousness will also
help us to understand and anticipate the resistance that women, as well
as men, can display towards policies which threaten to change the

Women all over the world face a critical shortage of resources to meet
their own and their families' needs. ,md the official agencies remain
powerful mechanisms of resource allocation. pote111ially capable of
meeling 01· exacerbating this deprivation. Whatever our final vision of
a society organized on feminist principles, we still need transitional
strategies to bridge the prese111 and the future. We need a more
complex strategy than one of militant disengagement with official
development efforts. In this context, a gender-relations analysis offers
a more nuanced view of official policymaking institutions because it
draws auention to the rules, rela1ions and practices through which
institutions are constituted. h becomes apparent that while these
institutions do undoubtedly embody class and gender privilege, they
do not automatically represent a uniform set of imerests; capitalism,
racism, patriarchy and underdevelopment may be interdependent,
but they are not the same. Their contradictory pressures within the
agencies create the space for a feminist agenda. ~ of the

As Sen and Crown (1985) have argued, we need to use these
contradictions strategically. An alternative 10 militant disengagement
might be cngagemelll with a view lo transformation - through
,·cscarch, advocacy and political strategics that challenge the assump
tions of neutrality which permeate the goals, objectives, rules and
practices of influential development agencies and help to disguise the
partial nature of their vision of development. Beyond these necessary
critiques, alternative visions also have lo be worked out by constantly
monitoring and evaluating the assumptions, procedures and outcomes
of all policies and programmes, and working out who gains and who
loses in the different processes of development and why.

Power and Resources in the Development Process
In this chapter, I would like to return to the concept of development,
but this time to approach it from a gender perspective. The earlier
discussion of the differing views on women and development makes
clear that development is by no1 :..:Q_s_an unproblematic concept. In
its n~.!.!Q.~eaning, it refers ro r 4nnelt process by whi!:h resowrees,

so on. In its broader sense, it refers"io·a purposeful project, no doubt,
but one with unacknowledged assumptions and unanticipated out

transformation unleashed by the attempts of diverse development
agencies at local, national and international levels, both within the
official domain and outside it, to achieve various, and often conflicting.

~oals. Given this l,ruader meaning, development can carry negative as
\,·ell as pt,sitive connotations. For s<>nte, it is synonymous with the
gradual and progressive expansion <>f individual choice; it has helped
to eliminate life-threatening diseases and to prolong human life
expectancy, to harness the energy of rivers for human use, to promote
new and hardier miracle crops. and to reclaim the deserts and
1narshlands. For others. ho\\•ever, development has simply defined
new conditions of constraint, enriching a few, impoverishing the
many, and in the process eroding both cultural and biological diversity
acrc>ss the world. At the heart of these contradictory outcomes is what
(;andhi pointed out many decades ago: that there are enough
resources in the world to meet the basic nee<ls of all, but not enough to
satisfy the greed of a few. Yet it has been the greed for profit of the
few. backed up by control over the levers of power, that has shaped the
patterns of distribution in develop,nent. Power in this field, as
elsewhere, derives from C<>ntrol over resources and control over ideas,
each form of control reinforcing the other. Control over resources
enables those in power to determine the parameters within which
debates and controversies in development can be conducted, which
prc>blems are to count within the development agenda, and which
subset of solutions will be considered.
'fhe power exercised through control over resources is particularly
evident in the international finan<:ial institutions where voting is
weighted by contributions rather than on the basis of one member, one
vote. In the World Bank and the I MF, the industrial market economies
share more than half the weighted decision-making process, with the
United States alone allocated aln1ost a fifth (Staudt. 1991). The UN
agencies have geographically representative staff. While this does not
guarantee that the UN represents the interests of all its potential
constituencies, it is generally seen as more independent of Western
interests than the Bretton Woods institutions.
·rhe US also dominates in terms of overall development assistance,
followed closely by Japan. Control over the flow of aid ensures that
development priorities in nati<>nal and international agencies reflect
donor priorities. Donor assistance rarely goes to the poorest countries
or to th<>se most able to use it effectively or equitably. Rather, it flows to
countries which are most likely to represent donor interests. US aid,
for instance, is directed mainly to countries of key strategic importance
(fc>r example, Israel and Egypt) while British and French aid goes
disproportionately to their former colonies. Israel and Jordan, which
received the highest aid receipts per capita in 1988 (282 and I 08
clollars respectively), also had higher per capita GNP (8,650 and 1,500
dollars respectively) than any other country except Syria, which had

lowest per-capita GNP (120 and 170 dollars respectively) received 21

assistance.
There are other ways in which sectional interests are promoted
within the international development arena. Grants and loans are
frequently tied to the purchase of goods from the donor countries, to
the use of their shipping companies, and to staffing, planning and
management by their technical experts. Recipient countries would
benefit far more from such assistance if they were free to go through
competitive tender rather than being tied to donor facilities. Among
six bilateral donors in 1982, the percentage of tied grants ranges from
Canada's high of 83 per cent, Britain's 78 per cent, the United States'
55 per cent, France's 47 per cent, and West Germany's 34 per cent,
down to Sweden's 16 percent (Staudt, 1991, p. 162). In the USA, AID
routinely uses the argument that 80 per cent of US foreign assistance is
spent within the United States to obtain Congressional approval for its
budget requests.
The call for a New International Economic Order in the early 1970s
stemmed from a recognition of some of these inequalities: 'An
international economic order controlled by a few rich countries ...
cannot be a just development order. All nations must have effective
access to resources and a share in effective decisions governing their
use· (cited in Arndt, 1987, p. 142). At a time when the international
agencies were stressing poverty alleviation and basic needs, the
countries of the South saw the global redistribution of resources as an
essential prerequisite for this internal redistribution to take place.
While it is the case that the NIEO gave at least rhetorical attention to
issues of class and poverty, it was conspicuously silent on gender
inequalities; the UN Resolution calling for the NI EO included only
one reference to women - it concerned women's biological role
(UNDP, 1980, cited in Maguire, 1984). 'fhus, despite its radical
agenda, the meaning given to inequality within the discourse of the
NIEO was a very partial one, itself a product of other underlying
relations of inequality which remained unacknowledged. In this sense,
while the goals of development might have varied between different
agencies, between countries and between the North and the South,
they were still premissed on certain core assumptions which allowed
them to recognize certain kinds of inequalities in the development
process but to overlook or deny the existence of others.

Power and Knowledge in the Development Process
Al<>ng with the promotion of particular policies, power in the
development arena has also been associated with the promotion of a
particular world-view. As we noted in Chapter 2. there is an intimate
relationship between the world-view of powerful development agen
cies and the kinds of knowledge that they are likely to promote. fund
and act upon. Excavations of the methodological foundations of this
world-view have helped to uncover the underlying hierarchy of
knowledge upon which it is constructed. a hierarchy which privileges
certain kinds of inforn1ation (scientific, p<>sitivist) over others (lcx:al.
experin1ental); and certain kinds of knowers (neutral, detached) over
others (con1mitted. involved). The origins of this hierarchy lie in the
liberal episten1ological tradition which views reality in an essentially
at<>mistic way, typified, for instance, in the Cartesian formulation of
scientific meth<:>d (cited in Shiva, I Y89. p. 29): to 'reduce involved and
obscure propositions step hy step to those that are simpler. and then
starting with the intuitive apprehension of all those that are absolutelv
simple, atten1pt to ascend to the knowledge of all others by precisely
sin1ilar steps·.
·rhis reductive approach to the pr<>duction of knowledge implies
that the complexities of nature and society can be broken down into
their constituent components. and the separate parts studied in
isolation fron1 each other. It operates with a hierarchy of explanatOr)'
levels. Sin1pler. lower-level events assume priority in terms of causality
as well as sequence over higher-level phenomena: 'According to this
line of thought, it is both possible and desirable to build solid
foundations to knowledge by isolating basic comp<>nents within the
social system and subjecting them to detailed investigation. ()nee the
cornponent is understood, we can build upon it as if it were a fixed and
immutable foundation for subsequent enquiry' (Harvey. 1982, p. 2).
Objectivity is essential to scientific n1ethod, so that knowledge is only
C<>nsidered valid when it is undertaken in a value-free and disinter
ested fashion - 'the s<>-called Archimedean standpoint somewhere
outsicle the reality that is being observed' Oagger, 1983, p. 370). l'he

regardless of who is testing them.
Reductionism has survived as a methodology because it offers an
accessible route to knowledge. Its treatment of social phenomena as
analogous to natural phenomena has a powerful appeal to common
sense views of how things work (Birke, 1986). Its satisfying simplicity

linear and hierarchical sequence of causality, commencing logically
upwards from the lowest 'foundational' level of analysis to the highest
aggregated one, explain why it survives as the dominant form of
knowledge-construction. But reductionism is also an approach to
knowledge that is fraught with problems. It works as a metaphor of
nature and society as machine, rather than as organic whole; all
systems are seen in terms of the same basic constituents, discrete,
unrelated and atomistic (Shiva, 1989, p. 22). It neglects complex
interactions between units, the interactions between the unit and the
whole, as well as the possibility that a phenomenon can be simulta
neously a unit and part of a larger whole (Birke, 1986, p. 61 ). Concepts
and units of analysis are reified, frozen into universal and unchanging
categories, robbed of the historical or analytical contexts from which
they originally arose (Weisband, 1989, p. 4). One consequence of
methodological reductionism is the isolated and piecemeal analysis of
problems and solutions, resulting in the frequent confusion of surface
appearance with underlying reality, symptoms with causes.
As a form of knowledge about nature, methodological reductionism
has served dominant interests well. It promotes a view of nature
broken down into its constituent parts, each of which can be treated as
separate from the whole and separately exploited without appearing
to impinge upon the whole. '[ I ]f the world is viewed as consisting of an
aggregation of bits, some of which can be directly exploited for
financial gain, then the overall effects of exploitation are likely to be
overlooked. 1·he effects on the global ecosystem of capitalism's
piecemeal exploitation of resources bears witness to this' (Birke, 1986,
p. 74). As a form of knowledge about society, methodological
reductionism has also promoted dominant interests. Originally a
method for understanding natural phenomena, it has been
transferred wholesale into the social sciences where it plays an
essentially conservative role, appearing to offer a neutral and objective
analysis of 'how things work'. Extension of the metaphor of the
machine to the study of society has led to the partitioning of social
reality into its component pans and an insistence on the separability of
these parts - of politics, culture and economy. Suppression of the
interconnections between these spheres has helped to conceal the
extent to which those who command material resources also exercise
enormous command over the lives of others and over the ideas of their
times. It has promoted a narrow focus on piecemeal inequities, led to a
separation between 'means' and 'ends' in policy analysis, and blocked
out consideration of the exploitative nature of the social system itself.
The fragmented view of society contained in the dominant world
view is mirrored in the compartmentalization of the social sciences into

helping to explain b<>th why gender was excluded as a category of
analysis and why this exclusion was obscured from the view of so man\
development thinkers. As Elson observes. most models informing
development policy are couched in abstract and apparently gender
neutral con, epts (the economy. the gross national product, the
1narket, the formal sector, the informal sector, and so on). 'It is', she
remarks, 'only on closer analysis that it becomes apparent that these
supp<>sedly neutral tern1s are in fact in1bued with male bias, presenting
a view of the world which both obs<:ures and legitimates ill-founded
gender asyn1n1etry' ( 1991 a, p. 9). In the rest of this chapter. we will
take a cl<>ser look at some of these key concepts in order to
demonstrate how reductionist forn1s of analysis help to disguise and
legitimate the gender asymn1etries which are embedded within the
central concepts of development.
Confusing Means and Ends
'Why do we ronfuse clevelopmen1 with econon1ic· gro·w1h?"
(Seers. 1979, p. !I).
Despite vigorous attempts at 'dethronn1ent'. econon1ic growth remains
fundamental to the most inAuential models of development thought.
1 ·here have been extensive debates as to how such growth is best
achieved: physical capital formation, human capital formation, and
technical innovation have all gained, lost and then regained favour as
possible ways forward. ·1·here was a brief respite in the seventies with
the shift in focus to basic needs and distributive concerns, but the
eighties saw the reassertion of the primacy of economic growth, with
the emphasis on 'getting the prices right' and r<>lling back the frontiers
of the state.
Proponents of econon1ic growth argue that without such growth,

DEVELOPMENT FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE
impossible to achieve. They recognize, of course, that economic
growth is a 'means' rather than an end in itself, but tend to argue that
achieving economic growth is the first priority. Once this has been
achieved, additional redistributive measures may be necessary to
ensure that it serves the real ends of development - improvements in
human well-being and expansion of choice. Unfortunately this separa
tion of means and ends, a hallmark of the liberal paradigm, has
allowed more attention to be paid within such thinking to the rate of
economic growth than to its pattnn. Consequently, redistributive
measures have never been seriously implemented either at the
national or international level. There are, of course, exceptions that
demonstrate what it is possible to achieve by way of human develop
ment when attention is paid to distributive measures. As Emmerji
( 1992) points out, Sri Lanka has higher adult literacy than Saudi
Arabia, despite the fact that its per-capita income is fifteen times lower.
Child mortality in Brazil is four times higher than in Jamaica although
its per-capita income is twice that of Jamaica. But these remain the
exceptions.
The confusion between means and ends, between growth and
development, has served a very real political agenda. Preoccupation
with maintaining the conditions of economic growth has detracted
energy and resources from attempts at redistribution to meet the basic
needs of all. Instead, economic growth has been pursued for goals that
have little to do with equity. Redistribution tends to get postponed on
various pretexts: because economic inequality is considered necessary
to provide incentives. because countries need to build up domestic
industry or military power, or simply because ruling groups consider
the current distribution a just one. The extent to which there is a trade
off between equity and growth has been - and will continue to be -
passionately debated and will not be dealt with here. What is relevant
to the concerns of this chapter is that the neglect of distributional
issues on political and economic grounds is reinforced by their neglect
on conceptual grounds, with serious implications for gender equity.
This illustrates graphically how 'ill-founded gender asymmetries' are
woven into the core concepts of development thought.
Writing at the end of the sixties, Seers suggested that the persistent
confusion between development and economic growth could be traced
to the common practice by planners of measuring a country's level of
development by its gross national product (GNP). The GNP was a
convenient indicator since it provided a single, comprehensive meas
ure of the wealth of a nation. 'It provided economists with a variable
which can be quantified and movements which can be analysed into
changes in sectoral output, factor shares or categories of expenditure.

and GNP measures formed the basis on which powerful national.
bilateral and international agencies formulated policies and mon
itored performance. However, it had become clear by the time tha1
Seers wrote his article that economic growth was not solving the
problems of development. Social and political difficulties continued to
beset countries with rising per-capita GNP as well as those with
stagnant or falling rates of growth. It was time to 'dispel the fog·
around definitions of development and to clarify what it meant. Wha1
Seers put forward was a viewpoint of development that was in
complete opposition to the claims made for 'positive' neo-classical
economics. ''fhe starting point,' he suggested, 'is that we cannot avoid
what the p<>sitivists disparagingly refer to as "value-judgements.''
Development is inevitably a normative concept, almost a synonym for
improvement. l'o pretend otherwise is just to hide one's value
judgements' (Seers, 1979, p. I 0).
The problem lies in how the (;NP is perceived: 'One defence of the
national income is that it is an objective, value-free indicator' (Seers,
1979, p. 14 ). It relies on apparently neutral market forces to assign
values to every type of product and service in an economy. The market
is seen as neutral in the sense of being morally random: it distributt'S
rewards and penalties on the basis of results, rather than effort or
intentions. In reality, however, the GNP is rarely a value-free measure
because the market itself is a highly partial mechanism for assigning
value. A fairly familiar issue in economics is the adequacy of income as
a measure of demand when the income distribution is unequal and
highly concentrated. However, further 'deconstruction' of the Gl'\P
reveals a deeper, gender subtext to this question. First of all, it is
important to recognize that while GNP is intended as a measure of the
value of a nation's productive activities and resources, what it actuall)'
measures are those activities and resources that are exchanged in the
market. In other words, the GNP equates the valiu of goods and
services in an economy with the prices they command or could
command in the marketplace.
Despite the claim by economics that the pricing mechanism is a
neutral arbiter of values, it is in reality deeply value-laden: it creates a
constant slippage in development thinking between using prices to
measure value to using them to confer value (Waring, 1989). Thus the
value of a 'good' is seen to lie, not in its ability to satisfy human need.
but in the price that it commands through the interplay of supply and
demand in the marketplace. A further level of disaggregation reveals
the gender bias implicit in this practice. l 'he forces of demand and
Google Original from

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA77
DEVELOPMENT FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE
supply are themselves extremely selectively defined when the market
is the defining arena. Supply does not refer to the full range of goods
and services that satisfy human needs within a society, but only to goods
and services which are offered for sale in response to market signals. Similarly
demand does not refer to the full range of goods and services that may
be needed or wanted by people, but only to 'effective' dnnand, or dnnand
backed l,y purchasing power.
An immediate effect of these selective definitions is that a major
section of the working women of the world disappear into a 'black hole'
in economic theory. A significant proportion of women's activities,
produced as a part of their familial obligations ('housework'), does not
enter the marketplace, does not earn an income, and is therefore
excluded from GNP estimates. It has no value as far as planners are
concerned. On the other hand, since these dimensions of women's
labour are either unremunerated, or else ensure their confinement to
the casual and low-paid sectors of gender-segregated labour markets,
the 'effectiveness' of their demand is also curtailed. 'fhey do not
command the purchasing power that would allow them to meet their
needs through the marketplace and must rely instead on the benevo
lence and efficacy of non-market forms of provision: households,
states or community organizations. Thus, within a market-led frame
work of development planning, certain categories of 'demand' and
'supply' are given secondary status in defining the means and ends of
economic growth because the market is not capable of assigning a
value to them. As a corollary, a major category of the working
population is also accorded a secondary status in the allocation of
development resources. The blindness of national accounting systems
to significant aspects of women's work gives rise to various kinds of
absurdities in economic analysis. A textbook example, familiar to most
students of economics, points out that when a man marries his
housekeeper, there will be a decline in the GNP since he now enjoys for
free services which he had previously to purchase. This is treated as an
amusing but trivial aberration in economic theory, unlikely to under
mine its fundamentally sound principles. Yet inclusion of 'housework'
would throw economic theorizing into considerable disarray and
woefully complicate its claims to make predictions about the state of
the economy. In the revealing words of an American labour

economist,
There is considerable warrant for considering such work (e.g. housework)
as not less real- and far more vital-than work outside the home. However,
there would be little analytical value to measures which always showed

and Ben.:h, 1987, p. 247).
Nor is it domestic lab<,ur alone that is excluded from econom1<
analysis, but all aspects of human endeavour and the natural environ
ment which have not been subjected to the same market-oriented
rationality: ··rhe current state', writes Waring, ·of the world is the resuh
of a system that attributes little or n<> "value" to peace. It pays no heed
to the preservation of natural resources or to the labour of the majori11
of its inhabitants or to the unpaid work of the reproduction of human
life itself - not to mention to its maintenance and care. The svstem

•
l ' he conflati<>n of prices and value is by n<> means restricted to
macrc>economic concerns with econ<>mic growth; it permeates all levels
c,f development planning, starting with the GNP and other macro
level statistics and moving all the way down to micro-level project
planning (this will be discussed further in (:hapter 7). It generates a
hierarchy of production which don1inates development policy and
determines how resclurces are allocated. 'l'he concern of developmeru
planners has been, first and foremost, with the measurement, evalua
tion and promotion of n1arketed go<><ls and services. However.
fc>rn1ally marketed goods and services are only the visible tip of the

ance of all kinds of other activities which are carried out beyond the
b<,undaries of formally recognized markets: the informal sector, the
parallel economy, the black n1arkets. Beyond marketed activities are
the subsistence and networking activities through which most poor
people assure their livelihoods and support systems. The extent to
which these activities can be included in (;NP calculations will depend
on the extent to which values, based on market-derived 'shadow·

large, these activities are unlikely to be responsive to market prices

maximizing calculus. l 'he tendency of economists to treat human
labour as somehow 'given' like any other factor of production tends to
obscure this point.:i The result is that the care and reproduction of
hun1an beings, undertaken largely outside the marketplace, will
always be excluded from any planning framework which relies solely

on the market to determine value. It is not simply that the system
refuses to recognize certain values, as Waring suggests. It is also that it
is unabk to recognize certain values. As Robinson pointed out in 1962,
the system fosters the ideology that values which can be measured in
monetary terms are the only ones that should count. The same point
appeared more recently in Jodha ( 1985):
The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured . . . the second
step is to disregard what can't be measured . . . the third step is to presume
that what cannot be measured easily is not very important . . . the fourth is
to say that what cannot be easily measured really does not exist. (p. I)
The hierarchy of production within the development discourse -
and the resource allocation that it legitimates - begins to make sense if
we consider the hierarchy of interests served by such a representation.
In particular, we should note that women are underrepresented in
activities at the 'tip of the iceberg', where development efforts and
resources are concentrated; they appear in larger numbers in informal
sector and subsistence activities. They are predominant - particularly
poorer women - in the reproduction and nurturing of human life and
labour, the neglected sectors in the policy domain. This skewed
representation demonstrates graphically the convergence of power
and ideas in the field of development. It ensures that women are
positioned within the policy debate as unproductive 'welfare' clients,
and that their claims on the national development budget, based as
they are on activities and resources which are excluded from calcula
tions of the GNP, are rarely heard in debates over budgetary
allocations. The unvarying labour of women and the continued
exploitation of natural resources are taken for granted, providing
what Waring calls a 'shadow subsidy' to economic growth.

revealing their interconnections and reversing the hierarchy of values
embedded within them. Although the 'reversals' we will be suggesting
in this chapter are specifically from a gender perspective, they have
wider implications. Development processes have generated many
different kinds of social inequalities, but gender is present in some
form in all of them. Understanding the ideas and practices by which
this most pervasive form of inequality is sustained contributes to the

nature. As we noted at the start of the chapter, the ·ways of kno"·ing·
that have dominatecl the procluction of knowledge in develc>pment
studies (and generally in the s<>eial sciences) have played an important
role in detining and legitin1ating particular viewpoints and methods.
·rhe pr<><luction of knowledge is theref<>re a logical place to begin the
project of reversals.
Our kno\vleclge of the world is constructed rather than discovered.
It is therefore likely to he shaped and limited by the location of the

always be partial because they are likely to rettect the interests of the
dominant class: 'Because the ruling class has an interest in concealin~
the way in which it clon1inates and exploits the rest of the population,
the interpretation of reality that it presents will be distorted in
characteristic ways. In particular. the suffering of the subordinate
classes will be ignored, redescribed as enjoyn1ent or justified as freely
chosen, deserved or inevitable' Uagger, 1983, p. 370).
Feminist contributions to this analysis recognize that oppressed
gr<>ups may sometimes be duped into acquiescence, denial or collusion
in their oppression. However, they also maintain that the reality and
relentlessness of their suffering can give the oppressed a very different
consciousness alx>ut the justness of the social order to that held by
dominant groups. It is not in the interests of the oppressed to hold on
to a partial view of society. but rather to see it in all its complexity and
its distortions: 'whereas the condition of oppressed groups is visible
only dimly to the ruling class, the oppressed are able to see more
clearly the ruled as well as the rulers and the relation between them·
Uagger, 1983, p. 371 ). Citing Nandy ( 1986). Shiva makes the same
point: 'one must choose the slave's standpoint not only because the
slave is oppressed but also because he represents a higher order
cognition which perforce includes the master as a human whereas the
master's cognition hast<> exclude the slave except as a "thing"' (p. 53).
This suggests that a very different form of knowledge and practice is
likely to emerge if it is based on what Hartsock ( 1987) describes as the
'feminist standpoint', based on the distinctive experiences associated
with women's lives in a gendered social world. It is specifically the
character of women's labour - their caring and manual labour - that
provides them with this distinct standpoint in relation to social reality.
However, the plea for a more situated knowledge based on a 'feminis1
standpoint' carries the danger of positing once again the universalism
of women's interests. As the DAWN group argue, 'feminis1n cannot be
monolithic in its issues, goals and strategies, since it constitutes the

political expression of the concerns and interests of women from
different regions, classes, nationalities and ethnic backgrounds' (Sen
and Grown, 1985, p. 13). l 'he group proposes instead that it is from
the vantage point of the most oppressed - women who are disenfr an
chised by class, race and nationality - that the complexities of , .
subordination can be best grasped and strategies devised for a more
equitable development. "I'his argument for a new paradigm for
development with equity was supported by Jain ( 1983), a founding
member of DAWN, who pointed out that gender inequality pervaded
all other forms of inequality - economic, racial, ethnic, religious - so
that any attempt to address it would also address these other forms. It
was also supported by Antrobus, who said, 'the strongest case for the
focus on the poor l "hird World woman is that in her we find the
conjuncture of race, class, gender and nationality which symbolizes
underdevelopment' ( 1989b, p. 202).
This idea that development theories and practice should start f ron1
the vantage point of the poor l 'hird World women should not be taken
to imply that somehow this figure is rnore knowledgeable than all
others, but rather that she offers the viewpoint from below, a
viewpoint that can help to realign development paradigms more
closely to 'the real order of things'. Nor should it be taken to signify
that only the dispossessed women of the l 'hird World matter, but
rather that without a structural transformation of the lives of the
poorest and most oppressed sections of all societies, there can be
neither development nor equity.
Because reversals in the hierarchy of knowledge are in the interests
of all oppressed groups, feminist researchers, advocates and practi
tioners are likely to find allies among others who share their critique of
the dominant paradigms. While the various grassroots movements,
environmental lobbies and social-action groups working directly with
the poor and dispossessed do not always share feminist priorities,
there are many overlapping elements in their critique of the know
ledge produced and validated through official development practices
in relation to the environment, to indigenous forms of knowledge, to
evaluation techniques, and to the perceptions and priorities of the
poor (see Agarwal, 1985; Mitra, 1982; Fernandes and Tandon, 1981;
Chambers, 1992). Within this body of work, the feminist critique has
been the most far-reaching, asserting that hostility to wornen is woven
into the very fabric of scientific method; that 'scientific objectivity' is
merely male subjectivity in disguise (Merchant, 1980; Keller, 1985;
Shiva, 1989).
Discussing these diverse critiques, Kloppenburg, Jr. (1991b) suggests
that they have a shared point of departure: 'the central insight that the

n1ental productions that we call scientific knowledge are no less su~ject
to s<>cial inHuences than are the products of any other way of knowing·
(p. 8). Just as gender was a S<><:ially cc>nstructed representation (rather
than a prec:ise reHection) tlf sex, SCl too was science a socially
constructed (rather than a precise) reflection of nature. What alsc,
unifies these critiques is the central place they give to a development
based on local, rather than universal, claims to knowledge. Localh
produced knowledge is knowledge which emerges out of experienct'
rather than theory, although it may inforn1 and improve theory. It i~
derived 'from direct experience of a labor process which is it.self
shaped and delimited by the distinctive characteristics of a particular
place with a unique social and physical environment'. As examples,
Kloppenburg, Jr. suggests:
It is /oral knowledge that infor1ns the birthing skills of the sage-s-femn1t'~
studied by Bohme ( 1984). It is local knowledge that enables the competen1
farmer to master the 'intricate formal patterns in ordering his work within
the overlapping cyc:les - human and natural, controllable and uncontrol
lable - of the life of a farm' (Berry, 1977, p. 44). It is local knowledge that
allows Robert Pirsig to keep his bike running through Zro and the Art of
Motorcyclt J\.1aintniance (Pirsig, 1974). It is local knowledge that enables
machinists to 'n1ake out' on the shop Hoor (Burawoy, 1979). And it is l«al
knowledge produced by workers that is the ol~ect of appropriation and
control in both 1·aylorist and ·1x>stindustrial' strategies of industrial
managen1ent (Kloppenhurg.Jr., 1991b, p. 14).
However, a cautionary note is necessary here. While there are many
convergences between different critiques of the dominant form of
knowledge production, there are also many divergences, particularly
in relation to how alternative paradign1s are to be produced. Such
divergences are also apparent an1ong f en1inist critics. There are those
who believe that all formal rnethods for gathering knowledge are
oppressive, that o~jectivity is impossible to achieve, and all that can be
done is to accept a plurality of views that are essentially incommensur
able. As Eichler points out, 'the logical consequence of such a
principled stance is that research, including the implied cumulative
knowledge it generates, is impossible', a conclusion that is tantamount
to throwing the baby out with the bathwater ( 1991, p. 11 ). It has
particularly disastrous implications for those who have to take policy
decisions, since it denies the possibility of a theoretically info nned
practice.
Eichler argues that it is possible to be critical of existing definitions of
objectivity without sinking into 'the rnorass of complete cultural

subjectivism' (p. 13). This would require a distinction to be maintained
between 'objectivity', which is based on recognition that a material
reality exists outside of the observer, and 'detachment', the idea that
the observer can step outside the reality being observed. Values are an
inherent aspect of the production and application of knowledge, but
need to be made explicit rather than being shrouded in neutralizing
and technicist discourse. Eichler's criteria for a more situated object
ivity ('an asymptotically approachable, but unreachable goal, with the
elimination of sexism in research as a station along the way' [p. 14)
entail a commitment to look at contrary evidence; the aim of
maximum replicability through accurate reporting of all processes
employed, including clear distinctions between reporting and inter
preting; a commitment to truth-finding or veracity; and clarification
and classification of values underlying the endeavour.
Reversing Allocational Priorities
'fhe production of knowledge has been an important site of struggle
for feminists working in development, but it is only one such site. Such
knowledge has to feed into the struggle for 'reversals' in the develop
ment budget if it is to have a practical effect on people's lives.4 The
arguments for undertaking a reversal of allocational priorities in the
planning process become compelling once we step back from the
taken-for-granted assumptions of dominant development paradigms
and ask ourselves once again what exactly the 'ends' of development
are supposed to be and what are the means to these ends.
The stark suffering of the past decade provides a fresh and urgent
reminder that development, in its best sense, must be about the
development of the well-being and creativity of all members of society.
The poor are poor precisely because they lack the means to live
healthy, active and secure lives. They are poor because they must run
down their only asset - their bodies - simply to survive. A 'reversed'
development which starts from the priorities of the poor places human
life and human well-being at the forefront of the planning process, so
that the 'means' of the development process are valued in terms of
their contribution to this goal. All human endeavour, whether
concerned with the production of goods or services, tangibles or
intangibles, is valued to the extent to which it leads to the immediate
satisfaction of human need or assures its future satisfaction. The most
valued activities, then, become those concerned with the care, nourish
ment and well-being of human life. Since human labour is necessary to
activate all forms of production, human resources are unique in being

If the satisfa<.:lion of hun1an need rather than the exercise of market

particularly poor won1en. would take their place as key actors in the
development process because of their contribution to human survival
and well-being among those who have been most disenfranchised by
growth-dominated development strategies.
Such reversals in allocational priorities are unlikely to occur without
a sea-change in the way in which policymakers make their decisions.
But as the extreme forms of hostility to state intervention that marked
the 1980s give way to policies which seek a judicious mix of markets
and state allocation. new opportunities for a feminist reformulation of
the development agenda become possible. 'fhere appears to be a
growing recognition in international policy circles (where hostility to
state interventions was most marked) that both econon1ic growth and
poverty alleviation are better served by 'governed', rather than
untrammelled, market forces. While the arguments which have
roused greatest interest predictably relate to the need for 'market
f riendly' interventions for greater economic growth, there is also an
increased interest in a 'human development' (UNDP, 1990) which
Google Original from

combines labour-intensive growth strategies to generate employment
opportunities for the poor with public provision of key welfare
resources. While this offers a more hospitable environment for a
'reversed' agenda than a neo-liberal driven one, we need to continue to
argue for policies that go beyond 'market-friendly' interventions to
policy approaches which are designed to equalize access to market
opportunities as well as to welfare provision; for what Elson ( 1988a)
calls 'the social management of the market'.
Connecting Welfare and Efficiency: Another
Perspective on Gender Equity
Within this reversed hierarchy of development priorities, a different
notion of gender equity to that promoted through early WID advocacy
becomes possible, one grounded in the interdependence between
people, resources and activities. It suggests that the opposition posited
in WID advocacy between welfare and efficiency needs to be re
thought. Although welfare ultimately relates to the state of human
well-being, there has been a persistent confusion within the develop
ment discourse between welfare as a desirable outcome of human
endeavour and welfarism which refers to the stigmatizing relations
associated with the public provision of welfare goods, especially to the
poor. The treatment of recipients of state-provided welfare goods as
dependent and passive clients has resulted in an unfortunate and false
polarization between 'welfare' and 'efficiency' so that any state
provision of social services is automatically deemed to create depen
dence and undermine the efficiency of the economic system. Nor is
this peculiar to developing country contexts. As US Senator Daniel
Moynihan wrote:
If American society recognised home-making and child rearing as produc
tion work to be included in the national economic accounts the receipt of
welfare might not imply dependency. But we don't. It may be hoped the
women's movement of the present time will change this. But as of the time I
write, it had not. (Cited in Waring, 1989, p. 8).
Although early WID advocacy was important in displacing the old
policy equation between women/reproduction/welfarism, the new
policy equation between women/production/efficiency has been con
structed on an equally impoverished view of women's lives. It has
defined women's economic agency as equivalent to that of men,
ignoring their greater embeddedness in familial and domestic

respc>nsibilities. If the care of hun1an life and well-being were to be
given the same value in development priorities as the production of
rnaterial res<>urces. then the provision of welfare services would be
seen as comple1nentary to development goals rather than antithetical
to them. It would free women lo pursue ec<>nomic livelihoods if they
chose l<>. or were compelled to by their circumstances, rather than
imposing a predeterrnined set <>f life choices on them. Planning f<>r
gender equity on the basis of social justice. rather than of formal
equality. requires recognition <>f the full weight and implications of the
gender division of labour in the lives of women and n1en, and of the
different needs, priorities and possibilities that it gives rise to. Gender
equi1y requires 1hat welfare is seen as con1plementary. ra1her than in
opposi1ion. to efticienry.
However, a gender equity based on rec<>gni1ion of difference rather
than similari1y, has irnplicati<>ns that go beyond equality of opponun
ity. Adapting a sin1ple metaphor about foxes and cranes used by
McAllister ( 1984) in arguing f<>r gender equi1y will help to indicate
why. If market co1npe1ition for scarce resources is represented as a
race across a stretch of land to get to a single saucer of food, then
market equity (reliance on free n1arket forces) will favour foxes who
are swifter on land than cranes. Equality of opportunity entails the
removal of discrin1inatory barriers to n1arket participation so tha1
everyone is treated the sa1ne: both f<>xes and cranes are to be fed f rorn
saucers. However, the fox still has an advantage over the crane sinre
the saucer is better adapted to its feeding requirements. Equalizing
agency requires recognition of different needs and requirements so as
to ensure equity of outcomes; f<>xes are fed from saucers, while cranes
are fed from vessels. We need not stretch the metaphor too far, but it
does help to draw attention. not only to the unequal terms on which
women and men en1er the public don1ain. but also to the formidable
barriers within public instilutions. ·rhe earlier stress on equality of
<>pportunity for women was prernissed <>n the belief that the problem
lay in discrirninatory barriers to women's employn1ent and their lack of
educational credentials to compete with n1en. However, as we noted in
the last chapter. public institutions have not evolved neutrally but in
deeply gendered ways. 'fhey reward certain kinds of skills and abilities
over others. and certain kinds of econon1ic agents (those unencun1-
bered by bodies, fa1nilies or sexual identities) over others. Con

public domain as long as public institutions do not accommodate the
different bodies, needs and values that they bring to the workplace.
Gender equity thus goes beyond equal opportunity; it requires the
transformation of the basic rules, hierarchies and practices of public
institutions.
Building Alliances:
The Bureaucratic-Activist Divide
Clearly, the official agencies of developn1ent, both within national
machineries and at the international level, have the resources and
social weight to play an important role in implementing this broader
vision of gender equity. However, this brings us back to the question
asked in Chapter 2: to what extent can institutions that have
systematically displayed prejudiced and stereotyped views about
women be relied upon to implement the goal of gender equity? There
has now been sufficient research into these issues to suggest that the
institutions responsible for development planning and administration
are not exempt from the gendered processes identified in the public
domain at large (see the review of this literature in Goetz, 1992).
Bureaucracies do not passively reflect the values of the wider society,
but are actors in their own right, with a stake in upholding the
hierarchical organization of gender. Research into gender relations
within bureaucratic organizations suggests that, despite differences in
the cultures in which they are located, and the resources which they
command, there is a remarkable similarity in the way in which
bureaucratic rules and practices actively reconstitute gender hier
archy. Women and men are positioned differently and unequally both
as the agents of policy administration and as objects of policy attention.
There are few women at the top levels of decision-making within
policy to transform this state of affairs, and even fewer who are willing
to challenge dominant agency practice (Goetz, 1992). Consequently,
even organizations that have adopted goals of gender equity have
frequently failed to implement them.
The continuing marginality of women's concerns is revealed in the
organi7,ational structures of national and international development
bureaucracies. As we noted in the first chapter, increasing awareness
of women as a category of development led to the setting up of
national machineries of women's affairs and WID units in the bilateral
and multilateral aid agencies. However, these tend to be 'often
perched on the peripheries of "mainstream" development concerns'
(Goetz, 1992). They are never located in the crucial 'technical core' of

are often literally no n1ore than a desk (Staudt, 1985, 1990). WID units

authority given to most WID units provide little leverage for carrying
out their ,nandates.
Staudt's analysis of the WID ofhce in US1\ID (cited in Chapter '.!J
pointed to the irnp<>rtant support given by its outside constituencies in
its battles to convince a 'recalcitrant bureaucracy' to allocate more
resources to won1en in AID-assisted countries. At the same time she
n<>ted the an1bivalent situation of women constituents, caught as the\'
were in the dilen1ma of criticizing. yet supporting, an agency that was
d<>n1inated by n1en and continued to direct resources to men at the
overwheln1ing rate of 96 per cent of programme funds. ·rhis is a
familiar dilemn1a for rnany fen1inist a(tivists, a dilemma f unher
sharpened for ·rhird World fe,ninists working at grassroots level
where they confront on a daily basis the disastrous effects of male
dominated, frequently donor-supported, development efforts. There
is a strong, and understandable, temptation to eschew all forms of
interaction with these ofhcially sanctioned vehicles of gender inequal
ity. Yet, as we argued in the previous chapter, it is important that
fen1inist activists do not turn their back on the official agencies of
devel<>pment, which remain the most powerful mechanisms for
resource allocation, with the potential capacity to satisfy or to
exacerbate the desperate imbalance in resources and responsibilities
that underpins women's sul><>rdinate position in most societies. While
donor agencies are rarely account.able to the populations of the 'J'hird
W<>rld, national governments are, at least in principle, supposed to be.
What is needed, therefore, is a critical scrutiny of official agencies for

in1portant insights for attempts to forge networks and alliances
between those working within and those working outside these

DEVELOPMENT FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE
WID practitioners within the agencies may be governed by their
institutional rules and incentives, but they are also charged with the
mandate of ensuring greater opportunities for women.6 Their vision
of development may differ from those of grass roots activists, but they
share a concern for meeting women's basic needs. This can form a
creative basis for coalitions, networks and alliances. WID advocates
within the agencies can help to expand the 'room for manoeuvre'
available to feminist activists by helping to channel resources and
create the enabling infrastructures that women need. They can also
provide an important link for feminist activists outside the official
agencies with powerful decision-makers within, so that the pressures
of a wider political constituency for a transformed agenda of develop
ment are felt by the agencies. Activists can play a valuable role, not only
in seeking official support for women's basic needs, but also in
ensuring that these needs are met in ways that help to transform the
conditions of women's lives rather than merely reinforcing their
dependence. In other words, ends and means have to be seen as
interrelated aspects of the development effort, rather than as distinct
and separate. To quote Beneria and Sen (1982, p. 173), 'because the
principal outcomes of the tensions between class and gender are the
differential overwork and ill-health of women, we must support
measures such as systems of water provision, electrification, sanitation,
and medical care and other similar policies, but with a strong emphasis
on how such programs are implemented and whom they benefit.'
Seeking allies within official agencies offers the opportunity to
influence the 'hows' and the 'whoms' of basic needs provision.
Beyond Planning: Strategies for
Women's Empowerment
·rhe concern with the politics of basic-needs provision is now an
important theme in feminist development practice. Molyneux's discus
sion of the concept of women's interests has proven particularly useful
in helping to outline a transformational politics that begins with the
day-to-day problems faced by poor women ( 1985). Since it will feature
in subsequent chapters, a brief summary is provided here. Molyneux
suggests that the concept of 'women's interests', while central to
feminist evaluations of social policy, is a dubious one because it
assumes that such interests are a given entity that can be either ignored
or overridden by policymakers:

Rt: VF. RSt: n R [A LIT I t:s
Although it is true that at some level of abstraction women <·an be said to
have some interests in ton1mon, there is no consensus over what these
interests are or how they are to be forn1ula1ed. ·rhis is in part because there
is no theoretitally adequate and universally applitable causal explanation of
women ·s subordination from whi(h a general a<:tount of won1en 's interest~
can be derived .... A theory of interests that has an appli<:ation to the deba1t·
about women's capacity to struggle for, and benefit from, s<x:ial change
must begin by re<ognizing differen<e rather than assuming hon1ogenei1,.
(pp. 2:-\ 1-2).
A recognition of different·e - not just between women and 1nen, but
also u1ithin categories of women and men - n1akes the concept of
'women's interests' highly contentious. 'Because women are positioned
in their s<xieties through a variety of different n1eans - class, ethnicit~·
and gender - the interests they have as a group are similarly shaped in
C<>mplex and sometin1es conAicting ways' (p. 232). Consequentl,·.
Molyneux suggests that the concept of gender interests be reserved for
those that 'won1en (or men. for that matter) may develop by virtue of
their S<>Cial positioning through gender attributes' (p. 232). However.
these may be practical or strategic, 'each being derived in a different
way and each involving different in1plicati<>ns for women's subject
ivity'. Won1en's strategic gender interests are derived in the first
instance deductively: 'fron1 the analysis of their subordination and
from the formulation of an alternative, 1nore satisfactory set of
arrangements f ro1n those which exist' (p. 232). Practical gender
interests, on the other hand, are given inductively and derive from 'the
concrete conditions of women's positioning within the gender division
of labour ... Practical interests are usually a response to immediate
perceived need, and they do not generally entail a strategic goal such
as won1en's emancipation or gender equality' (p. 233). Thus, by virtue
of their responsibility for f an1ily welfare within the don1estic division
of labour, women may be seen to have a practical gender interest in the
provision of resources that meet basic welfare needs.
Embedded within this distinction between the practical and the
strategic is a distinction between policies that address the concrete
conditions of wornen's daily lives, which are imposed by existing
divisions in resources and responsibilities, and those which seek to
transform women's position7within a structurally unequal set of social
relations. 'l'he structural inequalities of gender in different contexts
define both how men and women perceive their day-to-day practical
needs as well as giving them differing and p<>ssibly conAicting stakes in
the longer-run transformation of these inequalities. Examples of

DEVELOPMENT FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE
strategic measures suggested by Molyneux that could help lo trans
form women's position include the abolition of the gender division of
labour; alleviation of the burden of child care and domestic labour on
women; removal of institutionalized forms of discrimination; mea
sures against male violence, sexual exploitation of women, and
coercive forms of marriage.
The distinction between practical and strategic, between women's
condition and position, is useful because it suggests a way of looking at
the question of women's empowerment. We will be considering this in
greater detail in Chapter 9, but there are a number of points worth
making here. While most mainstream development agencies have
recognized the efficiency of factoring gender into their policy design,
and while some acknowledge the equity arguments for meeting
women's practical gender needs within the existing division of
resources and responsibilities, few are prepared to address the
underlying inequalities f requendy associated with this division. The
distinction between practical and strategic helps to unpack the very
real tension between policies which seek to distribute resources in ways
that preserve and reinforce these inequalities and those which use
women's everyday practical needs as a starting point for challenging
these inequalities.
As Molyneux points out, when official policymakers (she takes the
example of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua) seek to address
women's concerns, it is generally the practical gender issues, particu
larly those that serve the policymakers' own predefined agendas,
which are both 'safer' to implement and have an instrumental value.11
If there is a single important lesson for feminists to learn from the past
decades of development, it is that the political will for taking on more
politically controversial issues which address women's strategic gender
interests is contingent on women themselves organizing to demand
and promote change. However, solidarity around strategic gender
interests does not come naturally into existence. What has given
women's disenfranchisement its intractable character is not only their
exclusion from the main sources of power, privilege and prestige
within their societies, but also the ideological construction of such
exclusion as biologically determined, divinely ordained or rationally
and voluntarily chosen. Such beliefs are deeply rooted in the con
sciousness of both women and men, since they are acquired along with
their sense of selfhood and identity. Nor are gender identities unitary;
they are cut across by class and other social divisions. Solidarity is likely
to be most effective when it is built from the bottom up, in response to
locally identified needs and priorities, rather than imposed by some

false universalistic notion of sisterhood (Beall et al., 1989). Feminist
activists working in development have consequently oft en taken
women's given practical gender concerns as an entry point for
initiating a longer-term process of transf<>rmation, a strategy whi<:h
has been described as 'subverting welfare for equity'.9
In the final analysis, therefore, won1en's collective strength and
creativity remains the main ho1>e of a transf<>rmative politics; and here
there is s<:ope f<>r opti1nism. l)espite the reversals and setbacks that the
economic crises of the past de<:ade have wrought in the lives of women
- and men - throughout the world, there have also been important
and enduring changes. ·rhroughout the world, it has become apparent
that won1en's formal and inforn1al lobbies, organizations and move
ments have formed the harkbone of struggles to resist the predations
of a top-down developn1ent process. Perhaps the key achievement of
the Women's Decade is that is has helpecl to create an important
p<>litical space for the proliferation of both informal grassroot.s
associations and nationwide movements which seek to improve
women's condition and position. As Moser ( 1992) notes, taken
individually, these organizations appear weak, underfinanced and
disparate. But together they represent a diverse and rich movement
for changing wo111en's lives well beyond what is envisaged by the
official agencies of development. ·rhis can be seen as the most
important legacy of the Women's Decade. We will conclude this
chapter with the tribute paid hy the DAWN group to the resourceful
ness and resilience of wornen. all over the world, despite the odds
against them:
h is important h>r us in the women·s move1nent to understand and
acknowledge our own achievements and strengths ... It is easy to be
discouraged about the concrete improvements in women's economic and
social position. They appear to have been as meagre as the resources which
agencies and governments have actually directed to women. But let us look
at our experiences in another way. We know now front our own research
how deeply ingrained and how far back historically is the subordination of
women. What we have n1anaged to do in the last few years is to forge u1orld-
111idr networks and movements. as never existed before, to transform tha1
subordination and in the process to break clown other oppressive structures
as well ... Starting from little knowledge and training, and having to
challenge the full social, economic and psychological weight of gender (and
often class, national and ethnic) oppression. we have acquired skills and
self-confidence and the capacity to organize for change. (Sen and Grown.

DEVELOPMENT FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE
Notes
I A more immediate example of the distonions wrought by reliance on the
market to calculate the production of value within an economy was reported
by David Nicholson-Lord in the lndepnu:lnit, 31 May 1993. It relates to the
doubling of rates of skin cancer in the UK compared to twenty years ago,
due largely to the growing hole in the ozone layer which is letting in
carcinogenic radiation. Profit margins on suncreams are about 50 per cent
and the market is growing at 4 per cent a year. Noting the alliance between
Boots Chemists and the Cancer Research Campaign to promote 'sensible
sun behaviour', he suggested that Boots' interests in the campaign lay partly
in the fact that three of the five guidelines for sensible sun behaviour
entailed purchasing products (sun hats, sun cream and sunglasses). Boots
sell sunglasses and account for 47 per cent of the lucrative sun-protection
market. Nicholson-Lord goes on to comment, 'When the Treasury does its
sums. that portion of the£ 110m sun-protection market arising from worries
about UV radiation will be added to the gross national product and will
count as economic growth. Thanks to the hole in the ozone layer and the
skin cancer epidemic, we will all be that little bit richer.'
2 However, the adoption of imputation procedures entails leaving behind the
relative transparency of market prices in favour of a murkier territory of
assumptions and arbitrariness. As Pittin ( 1987) points out in her study of
Nigerian census data. measuring the status and value of women's work is
fraught with difficulties, many of which are related to the 'implicit challenge
to male domination inherent in the kinds of questions asked' (p. 41). The
absurdities which result from attempts at imputation generally err on the
side of underestimating women's contribution. Bangladesh census data
classified men who are engaged in field-based stages of rice production as
economically active while women engaged in home-based processing of the
same rice crop are excluded fron1 labour force statistics. Rice is generally
counted in the GNP, whether it is consun1ed or marketed. but kitchen
garden crops were for a long term excluded from GNP calculations
regardless of whether they were marketed or not. l "he Fiji 1974 Labour
Force Survey defined anyone involved in raising fewer than ten chic:kens as
economically inactive, while anyone raising ten or more chickens was
considered economically active.
3 Orthodox economics shares with Marxist political economy the apparent
assumption that an individual is born at the time of applying for 'his' first
first job (Jagger, 1983, p. 77).
4 Some examples will help indicate priorities within national budgets. In
South Asia, education accounts for 6. 7 per cent of public expenditure; in
Southeast Asia it is closer to 13 per cent. Throughout Asia, health accounts
for 3 per cent of public expenditure. Economic services (transport and
communications, infrastructure and power) account for around 36 per cent
of public expenditure in South Asia. ESCAP calculated at the end of the
seventies that minimum basic needs could have been met within all low-

members into an internally consistent family-utility function
attributes a role to the family that undoubtedly exceeds its
capacity as a social institution. (Schultz, 1973, p. S 10)
Schultz has argued that a household manager or decision
maker will internalize the utility functions of family
members through a high level of concern or caring for other
members and will also be more informed than other
(particularly younger) members. This is pretty much where
the theory rests at this point. (Evenson, 1976, p. 89)
Home is the place where, when you have to go there,
1·hey have to take you in. (Robert Frost, cited in Pollak,
1985)
The control and allocation of resources within the house
hold is a complex process which has to be seen in relation to
a web of rights and obligations. The management of labour,
income and resources is something which is crucially bound
up with household organization and the sexual division of
labour. (Moore, 1988, p. 56)

Economists and Others:
Dissent over the Household
An astronomer once suggested that students of the 'human' sciences
had pr<>blems distinguishing irrelevant information from genuine,
that is, 'signals' from 'noise':
Instead of separating the noise - throwing it away as the physicists do- the~·
spend their energies chasing through every detail of the darned stuff ...
Students of sociology might indeed be described as the ultimate studenL~ of
noise. (Hoyle and Hoyle, 1971. tiled in Sprey. 1990, p. 25).
A sociologist's rejoinder to this was, 'l'his is a somewhat naive, but also
worthwhile observation. Naive, because after all, one person's noise
n1ay be another's signal; worthwhile, because it alerts us to the fact that

1990, p. 26). Although these diverging viewpoints con1e from the
natural and human sciences, they capture remarkably well the
n1ethodological differences between neo-classical economists (still the
mainstream within the discipline) and 'others' within the field of social

sciences.
The simplifying core of ne<>-classical theory, as we saw in Chapter 2,
is the assumption of rational choice, so that all human behaviour is
explained as the attempt to maximize individual utilities in the face of
economic scarcity. l'he economic problen1 is reduced to n1aking non
prescriptive, 'positivist' predictions about how scarce resources are
likely to be allocated between alternative uses to n1eet this maximiza
ti<>n criterion. Neo-classical economists claim simplicity, parsimony
and elegance for their approach; they achieve these through a process
of theoretical and methodological reductionism. ·rhe bewildering and
contradictory complexity of 'everyday lived reality' is con1pressed into
a few, tightly bounded concepts which lend the1nselves to quantitative
approximation, econometric manipulation and determinate out
comes; the rest is discarded as so much 'noise'. The pre-eminence of
positivist thinking within econon1ics explains the privileged status
granted to 'value-free' quantitative verification of theoretically derived
hypotheses.
Criticisms of the neo-classical approach have existed almost as long
as the approach itself, directed primarily at its aggregating, averaging
and universalizing tendencies, and at the impoverished construction
of sc>eial reality which results. Structural constraints, institutional
processes and cultural variations - the 'noise' which neo-classical
economists discard - have all been invoked to challenge and 'unpack'
the tightly bounded concepts which constitute the neo-classical model
of the universe. Other disciplines have, of course, their own limita
tions. Sociologists, as we saw, have been described as 'the ultimate
students of noise'. Similarly, the relentless focus on ethnographic
minutiae of n1any anthropologists lays them open to charges which
reverse those levelled at economists, nan1ely, an antipathy to generaliz
able 'rules' and a preoccupation with ·exceptions·; an unease with
certainties and an emphasis on uncertainties; indifference to the
larger picture and immersion in the details of daily existence - too
much noise, in other words, and not enough signals.
While it is indeed the case that social reality is infinitely diverse and
c<>ntradictory, theoretical paradig1ns need to possess boundaries and
limitations if they are to be useful. The econon1ist's concern with
stripping human behaviour down to its bare essentials may be justified
if it can be shown that what is excluded is randoni or anomalous. If,

The New Household Economics: 'From each
according to ability; to each according to need'?
l\:eo-classical theory has not always had a great deal to say ab<>ul
households. Early versions tended to approxin1ate household beha

A n1ajor obstacle to incorporating the collective nature of house
holds was that econon1ic ,nodelling had been developed to deal with
individual preferences and behaviour. In an early exposition of what
he called the 'Mr and Mrs Hyde problen1', Samuelson (1956) articu

the New Household Economics. Becker's main contribution was to
integrate the production and consumption activities of the household
economy and to extend maximization principles to its internal
workings. In his version, 'Mr and Mrs Hyde' come together in
n1arriage because of their complementarity in biological reproduction
(Becker, 1974). Once they have formed a household, they behave 'as if'
they were a single entity, maximizing a joint welfare function, su~ject
to the household production function. They combine goods and
services purchased from the market with domestically available inputs,
primarily the labour of the f amity, in order to produce a bundle of
'Z-goods', the direct objects of utility (for example, health. nutrition,
recreation, child services, and so on). In order that the welfare
maximizing bundle of Z-goods is produced, productive resources at
the disposal of the household are allocated to those activities in which
they are likely to make the greatest contribution. Family labour is also
allocated on this principle of comparative advantage so that each
member specializes in those activities which give them the highest
relative returns. However, households could only be portrayed as a
welfare-maximizing unit if efficiency in production was matched by a
distribution process which also maximized the welfare of its members.
Here a problem arose. Unlike productive inputs like household labour
and assets, which were potentially, if not actually. marketed, individual
utility could not be given a transaction price. Nor was it generally
acceptable within the positivist tradition to make comparisons between
subjectively formulated utilities of different individuals.
Once again, the problem of assuring joint welfare maximization in
household distribution was resolved through the ingenious ploy of
assuming that this was precisely what happens. Some versions proposed
full altruism: 'the welfare of each member of the family is normally
integrated into a unified family welfare function' (Schultz, 1973,
p. S6). Willis ( 1973) suggested reversing Samuelson's argument; in
other words, 'the f amity exists as an institution because, given the
existence of altruism and nonmarket mechanisms for the allocation of
commodities and welfare among its members, it has both the incentive
and the capacity to resolve allocative problems' (p. S 19). Thus the
existence of joint consumption and inter-dependent utilities which, in
the impersonal environment of the market, would lead to maxin1iza
tion failures was irrelevant within the household where altruism was
the paramount decision-making principle. In other versions of the
model, selective altruism was assumed to ensure joint welfare maximi
zation. Becker ( 198 l ), for instance, accepted the possibility of 'rotten
kids', but posited the 'benevolent dictatorship' of the household head
to ensure welfare maximization: 'the household welfare function is

welfare int'quities in the sense of unequal \\·eighting being given to
individual utilities within the aggregated welfare function . If intra•
household welfare differentials are observecl, they are inferred to be
the outcome of a voluntaristir derision-ntaking pr<>eess, that is.
'household n1en1bers agree to (ertain h<>usehold management rules
regarding the distrihution of incon1e within the household, and the
all<>catic,n of household 1ne1nbers· tin1e' (Evens<>n, 1978, p. 2). The
dichoton1ous clepiction of household decision-n1aking as one of
n1arket efficiency in production and altruisn1 in distribution has been
compared to 'the prin1itive comn1unist rule governing the allocation of
the work-load and the distribution of consun1ption', viz. from each
according to ability; to each according to need (Saith and 1·ankha,
1972. p. 351, cited in Ellis, 1988).
While son1e modifications are made to adapt this household model
to conditions in other parts of the world, neo-classical economists are
prone to making powerful claims for the universality of their theory.
Becker, for instance, claims that rational-choice theory provides a
unified framework for all behaviour inv<>lving scarce resources,
be it behaviour involving rnoney pri<·es or imputed shadow prices, repeated
or infrequent decisions, large or n1inor decisions, ernotional or mechanical
ends, rich or poor persons. n1en or women. adults or children, brilliant or
stupid persons. b11sinessn1en or politicians. teachers or students. ( 1976.
p. 8)
However, there is scepticism about these clai1ns, even within the
discipline. Sceptics have pointed to the fallacies of aggregation which
underpin the Beckerian representati<>n of the household as an
essentially altruistic collectivity: the aggregation of individual utilities
into a joint welfare function; of individual incomes into a common
budget; of individual family labour into an abstract pool of household
lab<>ur; and of aggregating individual members into a single decision
making unit (Galbraith. 1974; Folbre, 1986a, 1986b; Evans. 1991; Sen.
1990). I will deal with these in turn.

GENDER AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMICS
Fallacies of Aggregation: Gender and
Household Welfare
Some of the earliest criticisms of the Beckerian household were
levelled at its assumption of an internal harmony of interests.
Galbraith, for instance, condemned neo-classical theory for 'burying
the subordination of the individual [woman] within the household'
( 1974, p. 35) and suggested that 'the household, in the established
economics, is essentially a disguise for the exercise of male authority'
(p. 36). Sen pointed out the absurdity of believing that only the
household head's view of the collective welfare should count and asked
why the views of 'subordinated' and 'subjugated' members regarding
their own and family welfare should be given no status ( 1984, p. 373).
The growing literature on distributional inequalities within the
household in both advanced capitalist as well as Third World countries
(see Folbre, 1986b) appeared to provide a further empirical refutation
of the idea of intra-household welfare maximization. The conflicting
interpretations given to these findings are usefully illuminated by a
debate sparked off by the Indian sex-ratio question. Macro-demo
graphic studies had drawn attention to the marked regional pattern of
sex ratios in the South Asian subcontinent, with more 'masculine' sex
ratios in the northern plains and more 'feminine' sex ratios in the
south (Visaria, 1967; Bardhan 1974; Miller, 1981; Dyson and Moore,
1983) . Micro-level research confirmed the existence of gender bias in
intra-household distribution. It documented not only the existence of
excess female mortality among younger age groups and among
women in their reproductive years, but also provided evidence of
gender-related differentials in household health-seeking and nutri
tional behaviour (Chen et al., 1981 ; Miller, 1981; Kynch and Sen,
1983; Mahmud and Mahmud, 1985; see also Jain and Banerjee, 1985).
One attempt to reconcile this apparent disjuncture between the
assumption of intra-household welfare maximization, on the one
hand, and evidence of intra-household welfare inequalities, on the
other, is found in Rosenzweig and Schultz ( 1982). They suggested that
the observed sex differentials in mortality rates in India could be seen
as a rational response by parents to observed gender differentials in
employment rates: 'children who are expected to be more economic
ally productive adults receive a larger share of family resources and
1
have a greater propensity to survive' (p. 814). The challenge to this
interpretation made by Folbre ( 1984a), and the authors' subsequent
rejoinder, neatly encapsulated some paradigmatic dissensions within
the field of economics. Folbre pointed out that, while discrimination
against female children might be compatible with parents maximizing

the total i11co1TU' of the household, it was difficult to see how it C<>uld be
seen as maxin1izing total welfare. Not only was the welfare of non
surviving fernale men1hers ex<:luded from the calculation, but the
productivity of surviving girl children was also undermined by lower
investn1ents in their 'hun1an capital'. ·rheir continued disadvantage
within the market place was thereby perpetuated. She offered an
alternative hypothesis that mothers in Indian households migh1
benefit more directly than fathers from the survival of female
children, since daughters comn1only assisted their mothers in domes
tic chores. However, mothers' preferences would not be reflected in
household outc<>mes if women did not participate on equal terms in
household decision-making. In place of shared preferences and
voluntaristic decision-making, intra-household inequalities could jus1
as easily reflect conflicting preferences and differential decision
making power. 'f"he same set of outcomes was compatible with more
than one explanation.
Folbre's alternative interpretation was rejected by Rosenzweig and
Schultz ( 1984) on the grounds that it required a more complex
theoretical structure, when the more 'parsimonious' assumption of a
joint welfare function offered a perfectly satisfactory prediction of
household behaviour. What was interesting about this response was
what it revealed about some of the stated and unstated preferences of
ne<>-classical econornists. First of all, it revealed what economists
valued about their theoretical models. While acknowledging that their
assumptions '(did] violence to reality' (Rosenzweig, l 986), economists
appear to give priority to the accuracy of prediction over adequacy of
explanation. The problem with this is summarized by Akerlof (cited in
Swedberg, 1991, p. 73):
l 1hink this maxin1ization business leads to slightly interesting exerc.ises and
it all looks very elegant when people do all this 1nathematics and so for1h.
But it may not n1ake people wiser. And in the last analysis we all want
something that makes people a little bit wiser.
Second, and less explicitly. it revealed the strength of the neo-classical
attachment to voluntaristic interpretations of behaviour, at least within
the family. The explanation offered by Rosenzweig and Schultz had
the virtue of protecting the private domain of the household from
charges of gender discrin1ination, relegating such discrimination to
the marketplace. It was the 'given' gender inequalities in market

invest more in male children. While this may have resulted in what

economists would call a 'greater propensity to die' among female
children, it still served the collective interests of the household.
Folbre ( 1986a) later pointed to the untenable paradox at the heart of
neo-classical household economics: the belief that individuals who
were guided by competitive self-interest in the marketplace became
selfless altruists when it came to intra-household behaviour. Scepticism
about the prevalence of purely altruistic principles within the house
hold does not necessarily rule it out as an aspect of household
behaviour. Indeed, the greater evidence for altruism within the
household domain than in most other institutions explains the
remarkable convergence between the neo-classical depiction of intra
household relations as akin to 'primitive communism' (Saith and
Tankha, 1972) and the conventional Marxist depiction of the house
hold as a haven in a heartless world, a 'miniature utopian socialist
society, untroubled by internal conflict' (Folbre, 1986a, p. 6). However,
the evidence of widespread intra-household distributional failures
suggests that the possibility of conflicting interests between household
members must be allowed for in household analysis.
Fallacies of Aggaegation: Gender and
Household Income
·1·he postulate ofj oint welfare maximization is itself premissed on the
underlying assumption that all household resources are (at least
notionally) pooled. 'fhey are then reallocated according to the
principle of Pareto-optimality, viz. a situation where no member of the
household can be made better off without someone being made worse
off. The identity of the household member earning or owning
resources is rendered irrelevant, since all resources will be merged and
then redistributed according to this basic decision-making rule.
Once again, empirical research has contradicted this premiss. In
particular, the gender of the person owning wealth or earning income
appears to have a systematic effect on patterns of resource allocation
within the household. The actual form of this effect varies in different
contexts. Thomas ( 1990) found in Brazil that the effect on the
probabilities of child survival was nearly twenty times greater when
non-earned income accrued to women rather than to men. Research in
the Philippines (Senauer, 1990) documented men's small but consist
ent advantage over women in the distribution of calories and found

that increases in won1en 's wage rates led to an increase in the share ot

a1
the expense of n1en.
Studies of contract sugar farn1ing in a Kenyan district found that.
despite the increased prosperity of sugar farmers, increments in
household incon1e did not translate into significant changes in tht"
nutritional health of women or young children (Kennedy and C<,gill.
1987; Kennedy. 1989). Exa1nination of decision-making within thest'
households revealed that women were responsible for food expend
itures and were more likelv to allocate res<>urces under their control to
,
consun1ption with observable nutritional benefits. ConsequentJ\'.
women-controlled inc<>me had significant and p<>sitive effects on
h<>usehc,ld food consu1nption. Sugar inc<>me, along with income fro,n
the non-farm sector, was mainly controlled by men, and spent on male
areas of responsibility with no obvious nutritional benefits. Evidence
that children from fe,nale-headed households did better nutritionalh
than children fron1 other households supported the idea that where
won1en's preferences dominated in household distributional patterns
there were likely to be positive nutritional effects.
Other studies confirn1 this picture of gender-differentiated patterns
in the disposal of income, with n1ale income n1ore strongly associated
with personal forn1s of consu1nption or what economists termed 'adult
g<>0<ls' (alcohol, n1eals eaten out, cigarettes and 'female companion
ship') while a higher proportion of won1en's income was spent on
goods for their children and f<>r collective household consumption
(Hoddinott, 1992). Reviewing these findings for Cote d'Ivoire, Had
dad and Hoddinott conclude that 'to the extent that increasing
W<>n1en's share of household income increases the purchase of "good'"
goods (and reduces the expenditure on "bad" g0<>ds) . . . there are
str<>ng reasons for raising women's incomes' ( 1991, p. 61 ).
·rhe empirical picture thus contradicts the assumption that the
identity of the me,nber earning or c<>ntrolling resources is irrelevant to
final patterns of resource allocation; rather, it lends credence to the
idea that household members have different preferences - or obliga
tions - which lead them to allocate resources within their jurisdiction
in systematically different ways. If altruism exists within the house
holds so that 'parents . .. care about the health, earnings potential
and/or food consun1ption of each member' (Rosenzweig, 1986.
p . 235) , such altruism appears to be generally more associated with
one parent, rather than both, and with maternal, rather than paternal.

GENDER AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMICS
Fallacies of Agg1egation: Gender and
Household Labour
One of the major contributions made by the New Household
Economics to the economic analysis of household behaviour was its
recognition of labour time as a key resource at the disposal of
households, and of the allocation of household labour between
multiple uses: market production, home production and leisure.2
However, enlarging the potential number of uses to which household
labour could be allocated has not undermined the fundamental
premiss that allocation occurs through a unified decision-making
process. 'fhe Beckerian model treats individual members as essentially
disembodied units of labour, differentiated from each other only by
productivity-related characteristics, and allocated to different activ
ities on the basis of comparative advantage. Thus, as Evans points out
( 1991 ), 'family labour time is treated like any other factor of produc
tion which can be flexibly allocated on the basis of its comparative costs
in market and non-market activities' (p. 55). If women specialize in
unpaid domestic chores within the household, it is because returns to
their market activities are lower than those of men. Within this model,
changes in returns to any member's time will induce the household to
reallocate its labour resources so as to restore equality in the marginal
returns to different labour units (Rosenzweig, 1986). Thus an increase
in women's market earnings will lead to their increased participation in
market work; their unremunerated domestic responsibilities can be
accommodated in a variety of ways. Previously idle labour (of children,
the elderly or unemployed members) may be drawn in to take up these
chores; or other members in less well-paying market activities will be
reallocated; or there may be an overall reduction in women's domestic
workload and purchasing of these services from the market.
That is the theory. What is observed, in practice, are various forms
of rigidities within the household division of labour, reflecting these
social characteristics, and acting as brakes on the equilibrating process.
The most widely observed 'stickiness' is in the extent to which male
labour substitutes for female in domestic and child-care activities. Data
from India and the Philippines, for instance, led Rosenzweig ( 1986) to
note (but not explain) an apparently 'closer substitutability' between
the labour of women and children, particularly girls, in domestic
chores. Consequently, increases in female wages lead to children being
withdrawn from school - and girl children from the market - to take
up women's domestic chores. However, other studies from the
Philippines identify women's time as the key adjusting factor. They
show that increases in women's market participation is accommodated

by reductions in their leisure tin1e; the tin1e devoted to domestic 't\'ork
and child care remains roughly the same (Folbre, 1984b). As Popkin
n<>tes, 'there is close to a one-to-one correspondence between increase
in maternal work time and the decrease in maternal leisure time·
(1983. p. 16ti). Even fathers who are unemployed, underemployed or
engaged in hon1e-based income-earning activities devote very little
time to child care. Folbre concludes from her findings that men not
only appeared to have no 'preference' for child care, but reveaJed an
active aversion to it. Furthermore (and contrary to Nakajima·s
suggestion cited earlier). it appeared that while altruism within the
household might, in principle. result in n1ale heads gaining some
utility fron1 their wives' leisure tin1e, they appeared to gain even more
from their own.
One result of these gender-related rigidities in the intra-household
substitutability of labour is that women all over the world, particular!}·
those f ron1 po<>rer households. have to balance a multiplicity of
demands on their tin1e. In sub-Saharan Africa, where women are the
mainstay of the agricultural sector, resp<)nsible for around 60 per cent
of agricultural production and 80 per cent of food production, there is
widespread evidence that women work longer hours on average than
men; in Uganda and Zimbabwe this is true even if only farm labour is
compared (Agarwal, 1985; Cleave. 1974). In the Indian context, Sen
and Sen ( 1985) found that p<><>rer women were most likely to combine
waged labour, income-replacing work (provision of fuel and water.
care of livestock and poultry) and domestic labour (cooking. deaning
and child care); specialization in purely domestic work was largely the
province of women from wealthier households. A review of six village
studies in Nepal suggested that women worked longer hours in
economic and domestic activities combined and had less time for
leisure and social activities than men of an equivalent economic
stratum (Bennett et al., 1981 ). Nor is this stickiness in intra-household
labour allocation restricted to the 'Third World. In the United States,
'despite "help" from husbands. the average working woman spends 80
hours a week on her paid employment and on housework combined.
compared to 50 hours for the average man' (Jagger, 1983 p. 70). 1\
recent governn1ent survey from Australia reported that women did
over 70 per cent of housework, whether or not they were in paid
employment.
'fhe reality behind these findings is that human labour, and
particularly family labour, is not just another factor of production. It is
different from other factors of production in that it has a gender. age
and status (Evans, 1991). It is also differentiated in that it has

amounts of power and agency. all of which reflect its social characteris

completely analogous to the allocation of other resources.
Beyond Unified Welfare Maximization:
Disaggregrating Decision-making Power
l'aken individually, each of these empirical challenges to the neo
classical model can be reconciled with the idea of 'altruism' within the
household. Brought together, however, they mount a serious chal
lenge to the idea of the altruistic household. Asymmetries in intra
household distribution can be reconciled with altruism in household
decision-making by positing differences in individual preferences.
Preferences, in the neo-classical model, are generally taken as exoge
nously given, stable and randomly distributed. Inexplicable behaviour
due to taste differences is allowed for, but is believed to be either trivial
or idiosyncratic (Amsden, 1980). It is therefore perfectly feasible that
some household members will display an idiosyncratic preference for
depriving themselves of food, medical attention and leisure tin1e in
favour of others.
However, when (a) the subordination of personal needs in favour of
the well-being of others appears to be systematically the property of
the less powerful category of individuals (won1en and/or children),
while the beneficiaries of such preferences appear systematically to
belong to another more powerful category (men), and when (b) the
consequences of such behaviour are life-threatening levels of ill-health
and malnutrition, then the notion of voluntaristic decision-making
becomes patently absurd. The tendency to treat the household as an
anthropomorphic entity within the neo-classical literature detracts
attention from the reality that,
the household can neither decide not think, since analvtical constru<;tS are
'
not so empowered. Rather certain people within the household make
decisions. One or n1ore persons with enough power to implement then
makes decisions and other less-empowered household members follow
them. (Wolf 1990, p. 60).
It is clear that if the distribution of decision-making power between
household members is to be opened up to analysis, then the household
welfare function, budget, labour supply and, above all, the decision
making unit itself will have to be disaggregated. Attempts to do this are
examined in the remaining sections of this chapter.

The New Institutional Economics: Implicit
Contncts and Household Bargaining
Not all econ<>n1ists n1ake a fetish of parsi1nony in their analysis; man,·
subscribe to Sen 's view that, 'like any virtue something is sc>metimes to
be gained by n1aking things more complicated'. A different perspec

econon1ic relationships. Here attention is paid to the boundaries.
structure and internal organization of different institutions, concerns
which are conspicuously absent in the new household economics.
Whereas conventional explanations of economic behaviour focus on
the production costs of econon1ic activity, institutional economics is
also concerned with costs of transactions between different economic
actors. In market-based societies where needs are met through
specialization and exchange rather than through production for use, a
nun1her of institutional n1odes exist for organizing production.
provisioning and exchange. The household is recognized as one such
m<>de - others are firn1s, governments and non-profit institutions.
Households can be seen as a specific institutional response to the
pr<>blen1s of n1eeting needs and organizing behaviour in an uncertain
world. 1-hey are based on 'long-term, implicit exchange contracts
between individuals of different generations related by binh or
marriage. ·rhese individuals, who have distinct preferences and
personal econo1nic constraints, pursue their self-interests through
family exchanges in a world of risk and uncertainty' (Todaro and
Fapohunda, 1987, p. 3). What n1akes the household distinct as an
institution is the close intertwining of economic and personal in intra
household relationships. ·rhe opportunistic n1isrepresentation of risks
and costs that is likely to occur in the impersonal arena of market and
state institutions is less likely or possible in the more intimate domain
of the family. This gives it a comparative advantage in organizing
certain kinds of transactions, particularly those where loyalty, personal
knowledge and son1e amount of altruism count for more than
technical con1petence and scale econo,nics (Pollak, 1985). The familial
relationships of marriage, households and extended kin networks can
thus be seen as specific institutional responses to the desire of
individuals for long-term stable environments in which to live, to bring
up children and cope with the uncertainties of illness, disability and
old age.
Institutional economics does not require households to display the
same degree of responsiveness to price signals that characterize

Beckerian households. Behavioural outcomes are likely to reflect
contractual rights and obligations as well as economic incentives. The
nature of household relationships means that such contracts are long
term ones, rather than renegotiated periodically, giving a certain
degree of stability (or 'inertia') to household behaviour. Nor does the
approach require altruism and consensus in intra-household relations.
As Todaro and Fapohunda pointed out, 'the terms of domestic trade
need not be equal but may vary, as in market transactions, with the
relative bargaining power of participants' (p. 3). The bargaining
process thus generates intersecting contractual relationships between
different household members, specifying their rights and obligations
to each other, as the basis of household cooperation. Individual
members are likely to observe the terms of the contract as long as they
are better off than they would be should the contract break down.
Attempts to renegotiate - and achieve success at renegotiation - will
reflect changes in individual circumstances which in turn impinge on
relative bargaining power within the household. Decision-making
within the household is thus seen as the resolution of potentially
conflicting preferences through a process of negotiation between
unequals.
Some versions of bargaining models tend to retain the voluntaristic
underpinnings of mainstream economics. Inequality between
members is reduced to their individual characteristics and endow
ments and they are able to choose non-cooperation as a possible
solution should the bargaining process not prove satisfactory. How
ever, household bargaining cannot be treated as analogous to bargain
ing between unrelated individuals within the marketplace. The
incentive for members to cooperate is not simply individual need but
also powerful normative pressures backed up by the threat of social
sanctions, which make the 'choice' of household membership a social,
rather than a purely individual, one. The neglect of these factors
reflects the larger problem of the neo-classical tradition, that 'it has too
little structure'. An attempt to remedy this is made by Sen (1990), who
offers a version of the household which retains the basic bargaining
format, but extends it in ways that address more explicitly issues of
gender and power within the household. Sen's household is a site of
cooperative conflict. In common with other bargaining models, he
assumes that cooperation between household members will take place
as long as it leads to outcomes that are preferable to those that prevail
in the absence of cooperation. The bargaining problem arises over the
choice between alternative cooperative outcomes, on the one hand,
and whether to cooperate at all, on the other.
The prosperity of the household depends on the totality of various

types of problems simultaneously, one involving c°'1J"alum (adding 10
total availabilities) and the other co11flict (dividing the total availabilities
among the members of the household (p. 129). The final selection
between alternative ou1con1es - that is, 'the particular pattern of
division offr uits that emerge from such cooperation· - will reflect lht'
bargaining power of different members within the household (p. 131 ).
Differences in bargaining power between members (or categories of
members) are the product of interlocking asymmetries, including the
range of options facing members, should household cooperation
break down (the fall-back positi<>n); the perceived significance (illusory
or otherwise) of their contributions to household prosperity; the
degree to which n1embers identify their self-interests with their
personal being (and therefore the extent 10 which they are prepared t<)
subordinate their own well-being 10 that of others): and finally the
ability of some members to exercise coercion, threat or violence over
others. Where these different bases of power coalesce, as they do for
men in many cultures, clearly the ability to shape, and indeed impose,

immense.
Won1en's 'perceived contribution' is an in1portant factor affecting
won1en's bargaining p<>wer within the household. This is likely to be
relatecl 10 the visibility and extent of 'gainful' work. The greater
visibility of remunerated, outside work is seen as a crucial factor in
determining women's fall-back p<>sition. Sen cites Bhatty's research
( 1980) with women workers in the Indian beedi industry whose outside
earnings appear to have strengthened their role in household decision
making and their claims on household resources. He also notes that
the home-based lacemakers of Narsapur studied by Mies continue to
be perceived as dependent housewives, both by themselves and by
their fa mities. 'T'he 'invisibility' of their work weakens their ability to
bargain for higher wages from their employers and for a greater share
of household resources.
On a broader level, Sen points 10 Boserup's contrast between
won1en's dependent status in the male farming systems of South Asia
and their greater autonomy in the female farming systems of sub
Saharan Africa as further support for his mcxlel. It suggests that
women's bargaining power, manifested in the degree of equality
observed in intra-household welfare indicators, is related to the extent
of their involvement in field-based and/or waged agriculture in
different farming systems. He also provides statistics from Africa and

Asia showing that female life expectancy, relative to male, is positively
related to female activity rates, relative to male. Thus sub-Saharan
Africa has the highest ratio of female to male activity rates, as well as
the highest female life expectancy relative to male; South Asia and
northern Africa have low relative rates of female activity and low
relative levels of female life expectancy. East, West and Southeast Asia
are intermediate regions.
A similar relationship explains the north/south contrast in sex ratios
and gender differentials in mortality rates within the Indian
subcontinent noted earlier. Thus the northern states of India where
women's labour-force participation is recorded as low is also a region
of 'masculine' sex ratios, with men outnumbering women ( l 06-114
men to 100 women) compared to the southern states (97-107 men to
100 women) where women have much higher rates of participation in
agriculture and trading. The relationship between gender diffe ren
tials in well-being and labour-force participation is thus given a very
different interpretation by Sen to that offered by Rosenzweig and
Schultz. The Sen model shifts the emphasis from gender differences
in the fact of productive contributions to gender differences in its
visibility, suggesting that women's participation in outside gainful
employment improves their bargaining power within the household
and is therefore associated with greater gender equality in the
distribution of household resources. Sen's formulation goes further
than other bargaining approaches in taking account of structural
factors that mediate between the individual and the rest of society.
Such factors can drive a wedge between personal choice and personal
welfare, a possibility that is not envisaged in the Beckerian universe.
He also extends the necessary en1pirical base for analysis well beyond
the prices-and-incomes requirements of formal household models.
Information from both within and outside the domestic domain are
brought into the analytical framework, thus helping to open up the
'black box' of the neo-classical household and allowing it to interact
with its immediate and broader environment.

As it happens, the san1e crilicisn1s have also been levelled at the n1ore
traditional econ<>n1ic nuxiels, despite their claims to greater parsimon,
and rigour. Utility, for instance, the cornerslone of neo-classical
theory, was des<:ribed by Joan Robinson ( 1962) as a 'met.1physic;1l
concept of in1pregnable circularity; utility is the quality in commoditie!I
thal 1nakes individuals want lo buy them, and the fact that individuals

(Hannan, 1982).
At the level of formal hypothesis testing. a major problem in
selecting between altruistic and bargaining explanations of household
behaviour is that they do not generate hypotheses that can be easil)·
distinguished from each other. Household decision-making principles
are inferred from observed outcomes, but the same set of outcomes is
compatible with more than one set of explanations. For instance, an
empirical correlation between wages earned and welfare differentials
among household men1bers is compatible with both joint welfare
maximization (maximizing household income by investing in
productivity of higher earners) and the bargaining model (higher
earnings enhance bargaining power within the household). Similarly.

n1atch gender-differentiated categories of income (continuous flows
versus lump sums; irregular versus regular; income in cash versus
income in kind) to different kinds of expenditure requirements. Or it
may mean that there are different (but equal) spheres of influence and
power. Finally, the greater amount of time women spend in child care
can be attributed to their choice, reflecting greater maternal altruism,
or to the absence of choice, a reflection of greater paternal
irresponsibility.
The difficulties of distinguishing definitively between competing
explanations of household decision-making are likely to persist as long
as empirical verification is restricted to formal hypothesis testing. As
Robinson ( 1962, p. 23) pointed out, the general problem with hypothesis
testing in the social sciences is that 'we have not yet established an
agreed standard for the disproof of an hypothesis. Without the
possibility of controlled experiment, we have to rely on interpretation
of evidence, and interpretation involves judgement; we can never get a
knock-down answer.' Hypothesis testing can tell us whether or not the
empirical data is compatible with a given hypothesis, but it cannot rule
out its compatability with an alternative hypothesis.
In the absence of knock-down answers, we will turn to other data
and other disciplines for insights into some of these questions. We will
examine how this other literature, mainly from feminist anthropology,
deals with issues of gender, labour and welfare within the household,
and in particular what light it can throw on the question of cooperation
and conflict within household decision-making. We will return in the
concluding section of the chapter to reconsider the earlier economic
concerns through the very different lenses offered by an inter
disciplinary perspective.
Anthropological Households: Socially Constructed
and E111pirically Diverse
·rhe first impression that leaps out from the anthropological literature
on households is the sheer cross-cultural diversity of household forms.
Indeed, some anthropologists have been led to question the very
validity of the concept of 'the household' (see Roberts, 1991 ). They
challenge the conflation of units of residence, reproduction and
production into a single unified entity, the result of which is that 'the
domestic group is often seen as monolithic, clearly bounded and
unchanging, except in so far as the domestic cycle produces changes in
personnel' (Pittin, 1987, p. 26). What they offer instead are 'shifting,
flexible structures in which boundaries are difficult to discern ... a

1nediated through marriage and kinship, creating a variety of conjugal
and residential arrangements' (Evans. 1991, p. 54).
Anthropol<>gists have also questioned the conflation of families and
households, pointing out that while familial rules are important means
of recruitn1ent into households in most cultures. there are also other
rc>utes to n1embership such as pawning, adoption, purchase. domestic
service and temporary residential sharing. Finally. they reject the
notion that familial ties necessarily imply purely voluntary and
altruistic interactions. p<>inting to the contractual nature of household
relati<,ns: 'persons related through descent and affinity may collabor
ate in joint household activities under more or less explicit contracts
which specify obligations and the resc>urces each brings to such
enterprises' (Roberts. 1991. p. 62). Despite the scope and validity of
these criticisn1s, there is a difference between abandoning the concept
of 'the household' as it is defined in most economic textbooks. and
abandoning the concept altogether. ·rhe empirical significance of
household relationships in the daily management of resource entitle
ments, and as the routine context of people· s lives, suggests that it has a
certain facticity. despite its shifting guises. Moreover, as Moore ( 1988)
argues. 'households are important in feminist analysis because they
organize a large part of women"s domestidreproductive labour. As a
result, both the comp<>sition and the organization of households have a
direct impact on wornen's lives, and on their ability to gain access to
resources, to labour and to income' (p. 55).
A useful strategy would therefore be to abandon the ideological
baggage of the new household economics and to seek instead
generalizable approaches to kinship-mediated economic flows which
could acc:ommodate the empirical diversity of household forms. A
valuable contribution to this is Friedman ·s formulation ( 1979) of
households as a 'dual specification', viz. as internally diverse institu
tions. embedded within and interacting with a wider array of networks
and institutions beyond their l><>undaries. One aspect of this dual
specification relates to the internal structures of rules and resources
within the househ<>ld, including those relating to marriage and
parenthood, property and production. authority and dependence.
·rhe other specification deals with the market and non-mark.et
institutions which jointly constitute the external context within which
househc>lds reproduce or transform themselves. The household is
then seen as a useful analytical construct whose content and ooundar
ies are determined by the wider social and political relations in which it
is en1bedded. We will use the tern1 'household' in the rest of this
chapter to refer to the bundle of relationships in a society through

which its primary reproductive activities are organized, recognizing
that these frequently involve principles of kinship and residence. The
economy of the household, then, refers to the rules, relations and
practices which govern household production, acquisition and distri
bution of the valued resources essential for meeting the needs of its
members.
Households as Institutions of
Resource ~anagement
While anthropological research has helped to uncover cross-cultural
variations in the boundaries of domestic groups, it has also pointed to
the existence of certain regional unifo rmilies in the social relations that
govern production, distribution and consumption within the house
hold. It suggests typologies of 'ideal-typical' household forms, based
on observed patterns of household rules, norms and practices, the
contractual basis of intra-household relationships (Caldwell, 1982;
Kandiyoti, 1988; Goody, 1976; Cain, 1984; Boserup, 1970; Dyson and
Moore, 1983). These typologies highlight the different degrees of
corporateness in household organization and their implications for
gender relations within the household. At one end of the spectrum are
the more corporate forms of householding, centred around the
conjugal bond, characterizing what Caldwell called a belt of
'patriarchy-patriliny-patrilocality' stretching from northern Africa to
Bangladesh, across the Middle East and the northern plains of India.
'fhese household structures roughly approximate those described in
Boserup's 'male farming systems'. They are organized around cultural
rules which focus on male responsibility for the protection and
provisioning of women and children. The practices of female seclu
sion, patrilineal inheritance and patrilocal residence interlock to
produce corporately organized, patriarchal household forms. The
social norms of male breadwinner/female dependent are reflected in
men's privileged, albeit class-differentiated, claims to material and
labour opportunities.
Such household systems contrast with the weaker cohesiveness of
the conjugal unit in the Caribbean, parts of Latin America and in sub
Saharan Africa (Caldwell, 1982; Cain, 1984; Goody, 1976; Guyer,
1981; Guyer and Peters, 1987; Youssef, 1974). In sub-Saharan Africa
in particular - the region of Boserup's female farming systems - the
empirical literature suggests the prevalence of non-coterminous units
of production, reproduction, consumption or residence and the
significance of lineage, rather than conjugal, ties. Here women and

· l'his contrast be1ween household fc1rn1s in different regions is no1
intended to suggest a rigid and unchanging 1ypology. Households are
constituted historically in the context of changing economic and social
transforn1ations: such transf<>rn1ations will be reHected in household
relations and produce regional forms which break with past patterns.
For instance, increasing comn1ercialization of agriculture and chang
ing land distributions in parts of Africa have led to the emergence of
proletarianized peasant householcls which bear a striking resemblance
to those associated with South Asia.
Clearly, most h<,useholds fall sornewhere between these 'ideal
typical' extremes. Within the South Asian context, households which
approximate the 'ideal-typical' corporate picture described earlier
occur most frequently in the northern plains of India, among Muslim
gr<>ups, am<>ng caste Hindus and among landowning classes. In
southern India, on the other hand, rather different organizations of
households and gender relations are evident. Female seclusion is less
en1phasized, virilocal residence (setting up a separate establishment
after marriage) is common, women are able to interact more regularly
with, and draw on 1he support of, their natal kin and sometimes inherit
and/or transfer property rights. Dys<>n and Moore ( 1983) suggest that

'West Asian' kinship system charactering the northern plains, and the
more egalitarian Southeast Asian kinship system in the south.
In sub-Saharan Africa, Palmer ( 199 l) suggests, separate accounting
units are more likely to be a feature of West African households where
women are most likely to be provided with independent farming land.
In East and Southern Africa, women farmers are more often a
combination of 'squatter on their husbands' (cash crop) land and their
husbands' farming agent' (p. 21). Their contributions are more likely
to be subsumed in the cultivation of household fields where ultimate
control over productive decision-making lies in the hands of husbands.
'fhe delineation of ideal-typical cases has a heuristic value. It helps
to focus attention on the key insights from feminist anthropological
research that the issues of appropriability, control and autonomy at
different stages of household resource management are likely to be
critical in shaping decision-making processes, with implications for the
extent and form of cooperation and conflict. We will examine how
these features are manifested in different household forms and
consider their relevance to the economists' concern with distribution
of labour, income and welfare within the household.
Gender, Labour and Income within
Household Systems
Anthropological research draws attention to the importance of more
or less explicit contracts within household systems which serve to
structure the distribution of rights, resources and responsibilities
between members in systematically different ways. Whitehead draws
specific attention to 'conjugal contracts' in different contexts as one
important aspect of household resource management, since they
specify 'the terms on which husbands and wives exchange goods,
incomes, and services, including labour, within the household' ( 1981,
p. 88). In place of the 'free' and flexible allocation of resources in
response to economic incentives envisaged in the Beckerian house
hold, economic behaviour within the household is seen as embedded
in contractual relationships between household members. As Moore
( 1988) puts it, 'the control and allocation of resources within the
household is a complex process which always has to be seen in relation
to a web of rights and obligations' (p. 56).
The contractual nature of household relations structures the ability
of its members to cooperate, acquiesce or dissent in household
decision-making processes. It ensures some degree of cooperation
between members as a necessary condition for their daily reproduc
tion, but it also shapes the potential for conflict. Bargaining over the

tern1s of the contract, then, reHects the kinds of resources different
tnembers are able to bring to bear on the process. However, the
feminist analysis of household bargaining shifts attention away from
the economists' emphasis on 'value and visibility' of labour contribu
tions t<> the hierarchies of control and command embedded within
different labour relations. Whitehead ( 1985) has pointed to two ·forn1'
aspects of the division of labour which are implicated in these
hierarchies. 1·he first relates to the nature oj· intertkpend,nct in the
production process. Women, she suggests, appear to enjoy less
managerial autonomy over production pr<>eesses in which tasks are
shared, either jointly or sequentially, with male members than in those
..
where production pr<>eesses are segregated. While both forms are
observed in the sub-Saharan context, Paln1er ( 1991) suggests there is
an underlying pattern: 'Won1en help their husbands in a more
corporate n1anner if husbands have responsibility for finding the
fan1ily's f0<>d. It is when wotnen are allocated land to grow the family·s
food that divisi<>ns of labour (and quid pro quos) are more in evidence.
·rhat is to say, the n1ore pronounced are separate accounting units the
sharper the division of labour' (p. 29).
·rhe significance of sequentially or jointly shared labour processes
stems from the fact that there are certain critical stages in production
where decision-n1aking authority has implications for the division of
resources and resp<>nsibilities beyond that specific stage. For instance,
a study by Burfisher and Horenstein ( 1985) of the Tiv people in
Central Nigeria suggests that the responsibility for planting was one
such critical stage. ·rhere was a close correlation over nine different
crops between who planted a crop and who managed it and the
proceeds from it.
Women's greater decision-making roles in female segments of the
production process will count for little if critical distributional de
cisions about workloads or the proceeds from production are asso
ciated with different and male-dominated seg,nents of production. In
any case, there is generally a less clear-cut basis for assigning value
added in production to the effort of various members when contribu
tion is on a sequential basis. It is consequently n1ore difficult for a
women to increase her share of the gains that result from extra effort
or to resist n1ale decisions about its allocation without challenging the
basis of the conventional division of labour (Whitehead, 1985) .
l'he implications of gender-sequential labour processes are most
clearly illustrated in the northern plains of the Indian subcontinent
where female seclusion is a widespread practice among landowning
households. Male lab<>ur. whether family or waged, carries out field
based supe,·visory or labouring tasks. Men are also dominant in the

marketing of produce. Women from such households are generally
responsible for the homestead-based processing of crops as well as for
income-replacing and domestic work. A significant feature of such a
division of labour is that it is not possible for women individually to
calculate or appropriate the products of their labour. Sen and Sen
( 1985) sum up the implications: 'As long as women's claims to the
household resources continue to be exercised through men (husbands
or sons), their contribution disappears without a trace, as it were, into
the household' (p. WS-55), in this case into a joint conjugal budget
which is under male management.
By contrast, women are better able to control the proceeds of their
labour where production processes are gender-segregated. Such
segregation can take a variety of different forms: separate fields,
separate crops, separate sectors or separate accounting units. The
contractual terms characterizing segregated labour processes tend to
protect female family members from arbitrary demands on their
labour time and arbitrary claims on their produce from other more
powerful members. Gender-segregated labour processes are most
marked in the West African context. It is evident in the division of
crops cultivated by women and men among the Kusasi in northeast
Ghana. Men grow millet, the mainstay of the local diet, and it is the
household head's obligation to ensure that the granaries are filled
through collective family effort on 'household' fields. Both men and
women also have 'independent' plots on which the former grow millet,
guinea corn, rice and groundnuts, while women grow rice and
groundnuts (Whitehead, 1981).
Jones's research (1985; 1986) among the Massa in Cameroon
suggests that segregation occurred by field rather than by crop. Both
men and women were expected to contribute to household supplies of
red sorghum, the main staple crop. Except for their labour obligations
on the compound, sorghum was usually cultivated by women and men
on separate own-account fields with little exchange of labour. Married
women had their own sorghum granaries which were drawn on first,
followed by the husband's supply of sorghum. The sorghum from the
compound field was generally saved for the hungry season.
The Mandinka in The Gambia also had a system of separate as well
as jointly managed fields (Dey, 1981, 1982). In addition, there was
some gender division of labour by crop. Women and men both
contributed labour for compound food provision but specialized in
different crops. Men tended to grow millet and sorghum for com
pound consumption, while women grew rice. In addition, they had
separate access to own-account holdings which they had cleared
themselves. Here men were most likely to grow groundnuts as a cash

needs. However, the introduction of rnodern irrigated rice has blurred
u• s status as a I won1en t s t crop.
In certain contexts, gender segmentation in the household economy
can give rise to what Palmer ( 1991) calls 'internal markets', in that
redistribution between n1en1bers takes the form of explicit economic
transactions. In l 'iv households in Nigeria, women are remunerated
for their lah<lur on n1en ·s helds with n1illet. which they process and sell:

often with interest. Secludecl won1en in northern Nigeria earn mone~
by processing the unsold part of their husband's crops or other
farmers· crops. Husbands have no clain1s to their wives' earnings.
Women may charge interest on loans of money or grain to their
husbands to provicle the family fcxxl. Some buy grain from their
husbands after the harvest and sell it back later at a higher price to
provide the meals which they share with their husbands. Manure f ron1
househ<>ld livestock is sold to husbands for use on food fields.
·rhe second aspect of the division of lah<>ur relevant to the
distribution of decision-making power within the household relates to
the differing potential for control or autonomy embodied in different
l.abour relationships, such as unpaid family labourers, disguised or direc1
wage lab<>ur, membership in patronage networks, or own-account
wc>rk. As Whitehead says. 'clearly the very notion of labour for others.
even within family relationships, carries with it the p<>tentiality for the
control and command of work to lie with the user of the labour rather
than its provider - a potentiality over and above the technically
implied control discussed above' ( 1985, p. 44).
Many studies report that won1en control, or believe that they
control, income which they earn directly, much more than that earned
by, for instance, their husbands. However. these findings appear to
hinge not rnerely on the incidence of earnings or the identity of the
earner, but also on the form of social relations within which income is
earned. As Mies's Narsapur study testifies, the constraints associated
with seclusive norn1s in India compress the range of options available
to won1en (particularly those fron1 higher castes and landowning
h<>useholds) to forms of work which are least likely to enhance their
bargaining power, viz. unpaid fan1ily labour or home-based earning
activities. Income per se appears less important to women's bargaining
power than access to new social networks outside the household which
certain forms of income-earning provide. While this point is implicit in

Sen's model, it is not brought out in his discussion of Mies's study.
Instead his emphasis is on perceptions of lacetnaking as a part-time and
insignificant activity. carried out inside housework boundaries and
between domestic chores, despite the reality that it was often a main
source of income in an area of high male unemployment. These
women earned less than did female agricultural labourers from lower
caste households, but were reluctant to give up their secluded status
for public manual labour. However, the isolated conditions of home
based lacemaking denied them access to the intangible but critical
extra-household resources of solidarity with other workers in the same
situation, an access which might have improved their bargaining
power vis-a-vis their employers as well as vis-a-vis the men of their
households.
In contrast, Hart ( 1991) notes the use made of collective bargaining
power by female agricultural work gangs in rural Malaysia to drive up
their wages. She points out its implications for women's bargaining
power in relation to other household members: 'women workers'
capacity to contest the ideology of male responsibility in the domestic
sphere ... is, I suggest, reciprocally linked with their capacity to
define themselves as workers, and to organize collectively in opposi
tion to their employers' (p. 115). In terms of the bargaining frame
work, women's higher earnings combined with their membership of
these newly emerging extra-household forms of cooperation
improved their fall-back positions vis-a-vis other household members:
'some of the women in these groups were either widowed or divorced,
but the married women also operated in considerable independence
from their husbands. Even where husbands were present in the
village, these women maintained separate budgets (and wherever
possible, savings) rather than pool their income into a common fund
(1992, p. 821).
Guyer ( 1981) has argued strongly for extending the concept of
resources beyond the conventional ones of land, labour and capital to
include what she calls political or social resources: 'much evidence
shows that where resources are not commodities, people have to invest
in the mechanisms which assure them continuing access. One needs
social and political resources to get material resources' (p. 102). Rights
and claims on people or groups of people can be acquired, transferred
and accumulated, often through participation in various inter-house
hold networks and associations (Fleming, 1991 ). The resource implica
tions of access to different kinds of extra-household relationships are
also pointed out in March and Taqqu's review (1986) of women's
informal associations in developing countries. 'fhey conclude that, in
general, women's esteem and influence within a community is closely

connected to the extent of their participation in extra-domestic
associations, but they distinguish between 'defensive' associations
based on women· s exclusion from male networks and more 'active·
associations with clear econo1nic roots and purp<>ses and orga11ized
al<>ng horizontal rather than vertical ties. The latter, based on 'the
shared econon1ics of being female', include rotating credit or labour
associations and can provide an important avenue to autonomy and
control for won1en, den1onstrably improving, rather than merely
protecting, their p<>sition within their households and communities.
Gender and Intra-Household Welfare Differentials
Focusing on the gender divisions of resources and responsibilities
among household members also deepens our understanding of intra
househ<>ld welfare differentials. As noted earlier, both altruistic and
bargaining models p<>sit a correla1ion between welfare levels and
economic contributions of household members, but offer differenl
explanations for it. In the former, the correlation is considered to
reflect the econon1ic rationality of favouring more producti\'e
members; in the latter it is attributed to the greater bargaining power
of more visibly productive members. 'fhe relational approach to the
househ<>ld outlined above is clearly closer to the bargaining vie"'
because of i1s stress on unequal power relations. However, it also
encourages attention to other dimensions in the link between \l.'ell
being and contributions which are not addressed in the competing
economic explanations. While it is the case that what women and men
do within the division of labour influences their individual claims on
household resources, it also influences their individual requi,·nnmts.
This point will be explored through illustrative data from Bangladesh
and The (;ambia as examples of corporate and segmented household
systems.
At first sight, the data from these countries appear lo support the
idea of a correlation between the visibility of women's labour-force
participation and their claims to household welfare resources. In
Bangladesh, 13 per cent of women are estimated to be in the labour
force and they make up around l O per cent of the agricultural labour
force. Here there are widespread findings of female disadvantage in
basic well-being (see review in Mahmud and Mahmud, 1985). In terms
of nutritional status. there is female disadvantage in almost all age
groups; it is particularly marked an1ong w<>men and children from
landless househ<>lds and women who are pregnant and/or lactaling.
'fhere is also excess female mortality in most age groups. Overall
female life expectancy is lower (46:47 years in 1980 [Seager and Olson.

1986]) in keeping with the pattern in most of South Asia, but is the
reverse of the pattern of lower male life expectancy in the rest of the
world (Sen, 1990).
The picture in The Gambia is very different. Seventy-one per cent
of women are estimated to be in the labour force and they make up at
least half the agricultural work force. In the region as a whole, there is
little evidence of female disadvantage in nutrition, and at least one
study notes greater female advantage in nutritional indicators among
children as well as adults (Svedberg, 1988). Estimates from The
Gambia show higher female life expectancy than male (35:32 years
[New Internationalist 1985]), unlike the pattern in Bangladesh and
South Asia in general, but in line with the rest of the world. However,
while there are obvious differences in the 'visible' labour of women in
these countries, certain similarities in their 'invisible' responsibilities
tend to be less obvious. In both contexts, women have primary
responsibility for the post-harvest processing of food grains and their
transformation into edible form; for collecting fuel and water, and
cleaning the house; in other words, for a relatively constant 'overhead'
of domestic chores which have to be performed, as a part of their
contractual obligations within the family, regardless of other respons
ibilities. Furthermore, in both regions, women have high rates of
fenility (an average of 6. 7 children in Bangladesh and 6.4 children in
The Gambia in 1980 [New Internationalist, 1985 ]) and are given main
responsibility for child care.
Juxtaposing these 'invisible' labour obligations with the more widely
acknowledged 'visible' ones draws attention to the very different work
burdens entailed for women in The Gambia compared to Bangladesh.
In Bangladesh, purdah restrictions limit women's contributions in
market-oriented production and field-based agriculture, accounting
for their low levels of 'visible' labour-force participation. In The
Gambia, on the other hand, gender divisions in the labour process
operate to assign women and men to different crops and fields rather
than to restrict the range of activities permissible for women. Second,
while women undertake the tasks of gathering fuel and carrying water
in both countries, it is unlikely that the distances travelled to carry out
these tasks in Bangladesh are as great as those in The Gambia, simply
because of the ecological differences between the two countries. In
The Gambia, fetching water requires women to carry between two and
four gallons per trip, the number of trips being determined by their
age, household size and distance to water source: 'drawing water and
its porterage are energy-demanding activities especially where wells
are deep as in the Gambia' (Haswell, 1981, p. 18). Third, in both
contexts, women carry out the manual processing of staple crops, and

in both it is regarded as one of the most burdenS<>me of their
respt,nsibilities. Yet the amount of tin1e and energy required is ven
different. In Bangladesh it has been calculated that an average of
ar<>und forty-five n1inutes a day is spent on paddy dehusking ('the
most arduous female task') for the average rural family (Greeley. 1987,
p. 223). However, the arduousness of the task has a very different
c<>nnotation in the West African context, where Nath (n.d.) calculated
that 'A won1an must spend six hours to get 6 kg. of processed grains.
the quantity consumed by an average household of six or seven
persons for one of the two daily n1eals and for leftovers for the next
n1orning's breakfast.' Haswell estin1ates that in 'fhe Gambia. this
activity was the highest energy user of \'.'omen ·s non-farming activities
(4.9 k.cals per min.) compared to 'drumming and dancing' (that is.
leisure). the highest energy user of male non-farm activity (5.5 k.cals
per min.). W<>men interviewed by Nath described the hand-pounding
of grains as 'the worst part of being a woman·.
When it is recollected that Gan1bian women provide around 60 per
cent of total energy expended in 'visible' farn1ing activities (Haswell.
1981 ), and that their less visible but routine domestic and child-care
activities are 'relentlessly performed even during periods of high
energy expenditure in the production of the staple food crop'
(Haswell, 1981, p. 17). clearly anothe1· look at well-being indicators is
called for. Disaggregating and expanding on the earlier indicators
reveals aspects of female disadvantage in The Gambia which remain
concealed if the focus is only on the value and visibility aspects of their
labour contributions. ()ne difference that emerges, of course, is in the
length of women's working days, both cross-culturally, and in relation
to their men. A review of time-allocation studies from different rural
areas in Bangladesh (Hamid, 1989) reports little difference in the
hours worked by women and men. In general, both men and women
worked nine to ten hours a day, with n1en predominating in direct
inc<>me-earning and women in subsistence and reproductive activities.
In ·rhe Ga1nbia a very different picture emerges. During peak
peri<><ls of agricultural activity (May to Decen1ber), 'pounding of
food grains begins before daylight between 5 and 6 am and women
retire to bed between 9 and 10 pn1 after the evening meal' (Haswell.
1981, p. 17). During the agricultural season, it was estimated that
w<>men worked just over twice the number of hours in farming that
men did (1 ,073 hours compared to 595 hours [p. 12)). When non-farm
w<.>rk is added to these estimates, it was clear that leisure and low
energy-consuming activities have a sn1aller place in the lives of women
than men. Men spent a greater part of the year with positive energy
balances than women (257 days compared to 201 days). During the
Google Original from

GENDER AND HOUSEtfOLD ECONOMICS
agricultural working day, aside from energy spent in agricultural
work, men spent 28 per cent of their energy expenditure in leisure
activities and 9 per cent in routine chores (primarily fuel collection),
while women spent 27 per cent of their energy in routine chores and
9 per cent in leisure. During non-farm working days, men spent
21 per cent of their energy in routine chores (housebuilding) and 59
per cent in leisure. Women spent 40 per cent of their energy in routine
chores and 40 per cent in leisure.
l"hese demands on Gambian women's time and energy show up in
forms of female disadvantage which resemble those observed in
Bangladesh. In both cases, this disadvantage is concentrated in
women's child-bearing years. While Gambian women have a higher
life expectancy overall than men, there is marked excess female
mortality among women in the reproductive years ( 15-50), a less
marked excess when the 5-60 age group is considered, and excess
male mortality only among the under-fives and 60+ age group (World
Bank, 1980a). In both countries, maternal mortality rates are extre
mely high. In Bangladesh, there are five to seven maternal deaths per
thousand live births; around a third of deaths to women in the
reproductive ages are from maternal mortality. While the percentage
of deaths among women in the reproductive years from maternal
mortality (that is, 29 per cent) in The Gambia is of the same magnitude
as Bangladesh, (Maine et al., 1986), the risk of dying in pregnancy
appears much higher in The Gambia, that is around ten per thousand
live births (WHO, 1987). Nutritional indicators also point to this
pattern of female disadvantage during the reproductive years, a
situation that is more severe in The Gambia. l'here appears to be a
cc,nsiderable shortfall in the calorie intake of pregnant and lactating
women in The Gambia (around 60 per cent of WHO/FAO norms),
compared to a shortfall of 75 per cent for the rural population as a
whole (World Bank, 1980a, p. 74). In Bangladesh, 66-70 per cent of
women in the reproductive years suffered from nutritional anaen1ia
compared to 80 per cent in The Gambia (New lnternatwnalist, 1985,
Table 10).
Clearly differences in the relationship between women's contribu
tions and well-being in Bangladesh and l'he Gambia cannot be
established purely on the basis of this data. Differences in poverty and
social infras(ructure would have to be taken into account. But these
findings do signal that women's work/well-being linkages work
through a wider complex of routes than allowed for by many economic
models of the household, and have to be taken into account in
understanding household welfare differentials. In the Bangladesh
case, the shortfalls appear to be a product of gender discrimination in

the distrihuti<>n of welfare resources. while in the (;ambian case. the\
appear more closely related t<> the distribution of women's "·orl
burdens and energy expenditure. In both case, women's 'illfare· - the
imbalance between requirements and claims - is exacerbated during
their repr<>ductive years, when the additional energy requirements
p<>sed by child-bearing and breastfeeding are not acknowledged in the
distribution of energy resources or work respt>nsibilities among
household mernbers.
l 'he diS<:ussion also highlights the need to go beyond minimalist
definitions of well-being in the analysis of women's status. Broadlv
aggregated indicators of the kind used in Sen's analysis provide a first
and necessarily crude picture of patterns of gender disadvantage. For
instance, while female disadvantage in nutrition and life expectanc~' is
certainly n1ore apparent in Bangladesh than in 'fhe (;ambia, data on
tin1e allocation would probably reveal greater gender differences in
leisure and sleep in the latter cc>ntext. Female longevity does not
necessarily imply a better quality of life: as we concluded in an earlier
article (Kabeer and Aziz. 199<)). 'rural n1en in the (;ambia no doubt
have a heavy workload. but their extra n1inutes or hours of leisure per
day con1pared their wives may well represent the difference
10
between well-being and exploitation.' If differences in well-being are
used as indicators of gender disadvantage, they need to be sensitive to
the spe<·ificities of gender inequality in different social contexts.
Rethinking Household Decision-making:
Dichotomous Rules or Structural Incentives?
How <lo the insights provided by anthrop<>logical research on house
holcls help to illuminate the economic debates discussed earlier? One
imp<>rtant contribution they make is to challenge the separation
between prc>duction and distribution evident in both the economic
conceptualizations of household decision-111aking. In the Beckerian
h<>usehold, a dichotorny is posed between competitive self-interest in
the marketplace and altruistic consensus within the household. Sen's
fc,rmulation effectively reverses this, juxtapc>sing cooperation in
proouction - 'adding to total availabilities' - with conflict in distribu
tion - 'dividing total availabilities'. Cooperation in proouction is
induced by the interdependence in1plicit in the sc>eial organization of
pr<>ducti<>n: 'technological interdependences make it fruitful for the
different parties to cooperate in proouction. In particular, the pattern
<>f division offr uits which emerges fr·om such cooperation reflects the
"bargaining p<>wers" of the respective parties· (p. 131 ). However, there

is no a priori reason why interdependence should be seen as automatic
ally cooperative; it can also carry potential for conflict, bargaining and
negotiation. Obviously, some degree of cooperation is necessary if
households are to remain intact; persistent non-cooperation is likely to
lead to disintegration. What is of interest is why conflict arises between
household members and the form that such conflict takes. Detailed
examination of intra-household relations suggests that, since women
and men are differently positioned in relation to the division of
resources and responsibilities within the household, they are likely to
have different, and often conflicting, priorities in production, distri
bution or both. However, inasmuch as households can be seen as risk
mitigating mechanisms, it also suggests that the actual management of
this conflict, the extent to which it is suppressed or overt, will reflect the
structure of risk faced by different members should household
cooperation break down. As the analysis in this chapter suggests, the
interacting gender asymmetries within and outside the household
domain set up gender-specific regimes of risk in different contexts,
including the risks faced by women and men in the context of
household conflict and breakdown. As Kandiyoti (1988) observes:
'forms of patriarchy present women with distinct "rules of the game"
and call for different strategies to maximize security and optimize life
options with varying potential for active or passive resistance in the
face of oppression' (p. 274).
The dual specification of households in different cultural contexts
can help to spell out how the interaction between intra- and extra
household relations shapes the risk environment - and hence risk
minimizing strategies - for women and men. Broadly speaking,
households which are organized as corporate patriarchal entities are
more likely to generate material pressures - and incentives - for
women to acquiesce, however reluctantly, in a centralized decision
making process. Such 'cooperation' represents their best risk-minizing
strategy, given their lack of extra-household options, should the
bargaining process break down. Conversely, segmentation of the
household economy and a more dispersed distribution of intra
household resources tends to be associated with greater access by
women to resources within the household and to extra-household
resources. Such systems are likely to entail fewer penalties for explicit
and overt gender conflict, and women may be as likely as men to
withdraw cooperation from the male-headed households, to live
separately and head their own households.3 We will explore this point
by returning to our comparison of different household systems.

Households in this context are characterized by strong systen1ic
sanctions supporting, possibly enforcing, cooperation in decision
making and by minimal incentives for women to engage in open
conflict over these processes. Bardhan points to the way in which
patriarchal household contracts reward female compliance and inhibit
open conAict and struggle over household objectives (p. 2265). Indeed
when cooperation breaks down, as in times of economic crisis, it is men
who are most likely to abandon their households; cooperation
becomes unviable if the cost of maintaining dependents is perceived as
too high. The 'patriarchal risks' (Cain et al., 1979) associated with
women's dependent position lead them to adopt overtly cooperative
strategies which maximize their longer-term security, often at the cost
of their personal well-being. As Kandiyoti p<>ints out, 'women·s

strategies to maximize their security always involve ga1n1ng and
keeping the protection of their men; through the adoption of attitudes
of submissiveness, propriety and self-sacrifice' ( 1988).
Material pressures and incentives to cooperate extend to distribu
tion and there is little evidence of overt conflict over distributional
processes. Instead there is a hierarchy of decision-making, needs and
priorities (associated with age, gender and lifecycle), a hierarchy to
which both men and women appear to subscribe. Thus women appear
to acquiesce to - and indeed actively perpetuate - discriminatory
practices in intra-household distribution in order to assure their own
longer-term security. Denied access to extra-household relationships
and resources, it is in their material interests to subscribe to the general
son-preference which characterizes this culture, and they invest in a
great deal of 'selfless' devotion in order to win their sons as allies and
insurance against an uncertain future. 'Maternal altruism' in the
northern Indian plain is likely to be biased towards sons and can be
seen as women's response to patriarchal risk. Women are not entirely
powerless, of course, but their subversion of n1ale decision-making
power tends to be covert. The use of trusted allies (relatives or
neighbours) to conduct small businesses on their behalf, the secret
lending and borrowing of money, and negotiations around the
meaning of gender ideologies of purdah and motherhood, are some of
the strategies by which women have resisted male power (Abdullah
and Zeidenstein, 1982; Kabeer, 1990; White, 1992). That their
resistance takes this clandestine form reflects their lack of options
outside household cooperation and the concomitant high risks asso
ciated with open conflict.
Such corporately organized households resemble in form the
altruistic household model of neo-classical theory, but apparent unity
in decision-making is imposed by the considerable power invested in
male family members rather than being adopted through a democratic
consensus: dictatorship without benevolence. Sen notes the possibility
of enforced cooperation, although he does not pursue it:
Not only do the different parties have much to gain from cooperation; their
individual activities have to take the form of being overtly co-operative,
even when substantial conflicts exist. . . . Although serious conflicts of
interests may be involved in the choice of 'social technology', the nature of
the family organisation requires that these conflicts be molded in a general
format of co-operation, with conflicts treated as aberrations or deviant
behaviour. (p. 14 7).

household rationality'. The introduction of an irrigated rice scheme
led to the emergence of a new contractual relationship, alongside the
pre-existing ones governing sorghum production. Women now
worked on primarily male-owned rice plots in return for remun
eration in the form of paddy and cash. While it would have maximized
joint household income for both women and men to devote more
resources to paddy cultivation - women by allocating more labour to
rice production and men by offering women higher rates of remun
eration to induce them to do so - neither sought to achieve allocative
efficiency at the household level. Women who were unhappy with the
remuneration offered for their work on the rice fields would refu se to
prepare their husbands' food as a sign of their displeasure. Some were
beaten as a result. They were also beaten if they refu sed to work on
their husbands' rice fields when not working on their own. The long
hours that women chose to spend on their own fields, rather than on
their husbands', reflected not so much the relative returns to labour
(which would have been higher on the rice fields) but the fact that they
enjoyed greater control over crops from their own fields. As Jones
suggests, the household internal market operated 'as if' it was a
bilateral monopoly, created by marriage and the associated sanctions
made available to each partner. Husbands and wives confronted each
other as the sole 'buyers' and 'sellers' of a particular kind of labour. In
the absence of joint rationality at household level, there was little
incentive to achieve allocative efficiency at the household level.
The potential for gender conflicts over production goals were also
brought out into the open in The Gambia by a series of irrigated rice
projects which sought to turn over irrigated rice land- a crop that had
previously been cultivated by women - to men in the compound. Since
women had no customary obligation to perform free labour on their
husbands' own account holdings, they were protected from these
den1ands from their husbands. The gender struggles within the
household which ensued concerned 'who would work and under what
conditions' and the extent to which wives' labour could be mobilized on
male-controlled plots (Carney and Watts, 1990, p. 226). Some women
withheld their labour and pursued their own independent economic
strategies. Others agreed to work (often for their husbands) on the
irrigated land in return for compensation in the form of wages, a share
of the yield or usufr uct rights over land elsewhere.
Separate productive activities may be cornbined with complementar
ity in consumption. As Guyer ( 1988) notes, an1ong the Seti in southern

productive activity, but acknowledge complementary obligations in
certain areas of consumption, including food provisioning and

expenditures on children (feeding, education, initiation and bride
weahh). However, the extensive literature on conflictual distributional
processes within West African households signals that such obligations
are not sm<><>thly effected through pooling and sharing but may be the
subject of exchange and bargaining. Jones. for instance, notes fr«)m in
her work among the Massa in Can1eroon the prevalence of 'fr equen1
and pronounced conflict' between women and men over the division
of income from rice production. Men's interest in using their wives·

more available and socially necessary ( 1985. p. 451 ). Whitehead points
out that, despite interdepen(lencies in n1ale and female f an1ilial
obligations and hence expenditure patterns, differing obligations can
lead to ctiffering distributional priorities and frequent don1estir
conflict, especially in conditions of economic stress: 'Rural women

Conflicting priorities over pr0<lucti<>n and consumption can lead
10
a perceived divergence between women's own interests and household
interests, as evidenced in won1en's investn1ent strategies. Robens
( 1989) notes how won1en in rural Hausa Niger invest part of their

order to build a significant network of credit and security. Hill ( 1975)
comn1ents that in West African farming households, women's invest·
ments, 'far from complementing their husbands" or being incorpor
ated into a general household fund, 'may be geared toward setting up
an insurance against divorce', often by investing in their natal kin
groups after marriage (cited in Guyer, 1988). Leach also reports how
young married women in Sierra Leone prefer not to invest their
labour in growing trees on their husbands' land because they do not
consider then1selves to be 'permanent residents' in their married
hon1es (Leach, 1990).
'I"hus, women's responses t<> marital risk and uncertainty often

Conclusion: Overcoming Conceptual and
Methodological Dichotomies
At the beginning of this chapter it was noted that economists had
achieved the formal elegance of their models by sacrificing the
bewildering and contradictory complexity of everyday reality. This
chapter has sought to reverse this process, sacrificing elegance for a
noisier, messier understanding of social prc>eesses. This has involved
bridging a number of normative dichotomies which define and limit
economic thought. The first is the dichotomy that privileges indivi
duals at the expense of structures. The concentration on the individual
and the exclusion of the social relationships which connect different
categories of individuals and help to organize their activities explains
to some extent the relentless voluntarism of neo-classical explanations
of individual behaviour. There is no space here to consider power as a
structural relationship, as socially entrenched asymmetries in rules
and resources that enable some categories of individuals to constrain
and shape the options and actions of others. Inequality is perceived
only in terms of individual endowments; conflict takes the form of
competition between individuals; and power implies decision-making
power. The structural dimensions of gender and other inequalities are
not merely ignored in mainstream neo-classical economics, but are
inconceivabk.
The second dichotomy relates to the distinction economists make
between 'economic' and 'cultural'. 'Culture' is generally used within
this literature to refer to all those norms, customs and practices that
prevent full and certain prediction of people's behaviour by principles
of economic maximization alone. Culture, it could be said, is the other
things people value aside from scarce good and services. One version
of economics denies that culture is at all relevant to economic
problems; all behaviour can be explained in terms of prices and
incomes (Stigler and Becker, 1977). An intermediate version acknow
ledges that 'non-economic' factors are important, but argues that 'the
net effect of economic factors should be perceptible while allowing for
the non-economic' (Cassen, 1978, p. 7 5 ). A third position acknow
ledges that culture can constrain the 'rational' allocation of resources
within the household: 'Where this is the case the subordination of
women may sometimes be found to have a practical economic effect on

the material conditions of survival of the household, quite a pan from
its meaning in terms of the inferior social status of farm women· (Ellis.
1988. p. 183).
·rhe argument here suggests that the dichotomy between 'economic·
and 'cultural' is one of methodological convenience rather than
en1pirical accuracy. In practice. ec<>nornic processes frequently work
through cultural relations, and cultural 'rules' have concrete, material
effects. Rather than leaving cultural phenornena to 'whoever studies
and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists~
sociobiologists?)' (Stigler and Becker, 1977), or explaining them purely
in terms of prices and incon1es, this chapter has sought to demonstrate
that an inclusion of allocative rules, aside from those of the n1arket.
would considerably in1prove our understanding of household pro
cesses and outcomes.
A final dich<>tomy, and one that is closely related to the other two, is
the n1ethodological one between quantitative and qualitative analysis.
The positivist tradition is not unique to economics, but economists
have den1onstrated the greatest faith within the social sciences in the
scientific status of quantitative knowledge and the least respect for
qualitative insights. However, there are significant dimensions of the
human experience that do not lend then1selves to enumeration. One
such dimension that has figured pron1inently in this chapter is that of
power. Quantitative approaches may be able to measure 'statistically
important' areas of decision-making power for women and men, but
the elusiveness of power lies precisely in its resistance to 'objective'
observation. ·rhis point has been made repeatedly in feminist scholar
ship, but also appears in other analyses of power. It is contained in
Foucault's observation that 'power is tolerable only when a good deal
of its workings are concealed' (cited in Wilson, 1991 ). The divergence
between personal well-being and perceived interest that Sen posits in
his household model n<>t only undermines an individual's ability to
bargain for a favourable share of household resources, but is itself
indicative of an already unequal division of power among household
members. This is not, however, an insight that can be easily quantified.
The elusiveness of gender power within the household is the greater
because of its embeddedness in the most intimate arena of human
relationships, that of the family: in no other institution are relation
ships 'so extended in time, so intensive in contact, so dense in their
interweaving of economics, en1otion, power and resistance (Connell,
1987, p. 121 ). It is highly unlikely that the subtle and concealed nature
of such power will reveal itself through the format of a highly
structured and standardized questionnaire. It is frequently the
'silences· and 'absences' within the research encounter, the information

that is withheld rather than that which is volunteered, which signal the
presence of disempowering relations (see, for instance, Wilson, 1991 ).
By their privileging of individuals to the exclusion of structures, of the
economic over the cultural, and of 'objective' quantitative predictions
over qualitative explanations, neo-classical economists have succeeded
in drawing a veil over the power dimension of intra-household
relations. They demonstrate the core of truth in Robin Morgan's
( 1977, p. 15) blunt assertion that, 'the either/or dichotomy is inher
ently, classically patriarchal'.
Notes
I There is a theoretical circularity in neo-classical explanations of the link
between gender inequality within households and within markets. In this
example, lower investment in women's 'human capital' is attributed lo their
poorer employment prospects. Elsewhere, however, lower investment in
women's human capital (specifically education) is blamed for their lower
rates of labour-force participation (Appleton el al., 1990). In other words, in
some explanations, market differentials are taken as given and explain
women's disadvantage in intra-household resource allocations; in others,
intra-household resource allocations are taken as given and explain
women's disadvantage in the marketplace. As Amsden (1980) points out,
divorced from the underlying social realities, maximization principles
become little more than justifications for an unjust status quo.
2 Unlike the New Household Economics, which distinguishes between home
production, leisure and market work, previous neo-classical models treated
household/individual labour supply decisions as a choice between paid
employment and leisure. As Dex observes, the practice of describing all
activities other than paid employment as 'leisure' was a peculiarly male
choice of label ( 1985, p. 64).

proportion of women who chose to head their own households in her

Introduction
In this chapter I would like to pursue further the c<>nnection between
concepts and method, focusing this tin1e on the question of po"erty
and poverty measuren1ent. There are two major challenges in
developing an appropriate approach to the evaluation of living
standards and they pull in different directions (Sen, 1987, p. 20). ·rhe
first is Lhe challenge of relevance. which demands that we recognise
the inherent con1plexities of the idea rather than reducing it to some
convenient, but arbitrary, index. Chan1bers has written eloquently on
the tendency to define poverty in a way that 'blurs distinctions and
sustains stereotypes of the arnorphous and undifferentiated n1ass of
the p<>or' (Chambers, 1989, p. I). On the other hand, the approach
needs to he practical in the sense of usability for actual assessn1ent of
living standards, a requirernent which necessarily in1poses a restriction
on the kinds and quantities of information which can be incorporated.
'Relevance wants us to be ambitious; usability urges restraint' (Sen.
1987, p. 20).

BEYOND THE POVERTY LINE
Some form of measurement is central in monitoring exercises since
the objective is to compare the incidence of a particular phenomenon
at intervals over a period of time in order to determine the direction
and magnitude of trends. Monitoring entails the conceptualization of
the relevant phenomenon, the development of appropriate measures,
and then the assessment of changes in this measure. In the next
section, I will be discussing the conceptualization of poverty in
mainstream development literature and the forms of measurement it
has given rise to. I will be pointing to some of the exclusions entailed in
this conceptualization and their roots in a particular ideology of intra
household relations. The rest of the chapter outlines an alternative
framework for conceptualizing poverty, one which is less prone to
these selective exclusions. l'he analysis in this chapter is based on my
involvement in developing a methodology for monitoring poverty in
rural Bangladesh, and I will be using empirical examples from rural
Bangladesh both from my own field visits and from the existing
literature to demonstrate the significance of gender relations within
such a framework.
Alternative Conceptualizations of Poverty
A useful starting point for discussing different ways of looking al
poverty is the idea of deprivation: the poor are those who are deprived
of basic human needs. Poverty can then be captured in terms of an
'ends' perspective - the actual levels of deprivation - or a 'means'
perspective - the adequacy of resources to avoid deprivation. As we
noted in Chapter 2, economists tend not to concern themselves with
ends as such, but with the scarcity of the means by which these ends are
realized. Consequently, the conceptualizations and measures of
poverty offered by economists tend to focus on the scarcity of means
rather than the achievement of ends. The poverty line, one of the most
widely used measures of poverty, exemplifies this approach. The
poverty line identifies poverty with shortfalls in household purchasing
power. It is represented by the average amount of income necessary to
purchase enough food for all members of an 'average-sized' house
hold to meet their average daily recommended calorie requirements.
Households are classified as poor or non-poor depending on whether
their income is below or above the poverty line. While any attempt to
reduce poverty to quantifiable dimensions necessarily entails simplifi
cation, there are particular dangers in reducing it to a single
undimensional index.

REVERSE() REALITIES
First of all, the dichoton1ous classification system of the poverty line
n1eans that it is insensitive to changes in the absolute levels of poverty
and to changes in the distribution of poverty on either side of the line
(Sen, 1982b). Its focus on purchasing power rather than achieved
consumption rules out n<>n-market consumption possibilities (for
example, self-provisioning, barter, state provision or common prop
erty resources). Yet these are likely to be of some significance in the
partially monetized economies of most l"hird World countries,
particularly among the poor. Second, its concern is entirely with
measuring the extent to which household income is sufficient to
achieve an 'acceptable' level of household welfare. How households
choose to allocate this income is seen to be a matter for private choice
rather than public policy. As long as altruistic principles of distribution
within the household prevail, they will ensure that the burden of
poverty is equally distributed so that all household ,nembers are
equally poor. However, if the argun1ents of the previous chapter are
accepted, then it becon1es clear that choice is selectively, not equally.
exercised by the household membership so that welfare outcomes
reflect relations of power rather than democratic consensus. In fact.
the evidence cited in the previous chapter of a systematic gender, and
age, bias in intra-household welfare distribution suggests that women
and children are likely to be disproportionately represented in the
ranks of those below the poverty line. It also suggests that where
won1en are denied control over productive resources, such biases are
likely to be more marked.
The problem with household-based measures of poverty, therefore.
is that they render invisible inequalities within the household with
respect to ends as well as means. A more effective methodology for
capturing the 'constitutive plurality' (Sen, 1987, p. 2) of poverty might
be the use of key human indicators along with a composite household
based index. Key indicators make room for the varying experiences
and priorities of different poverty groups and for varying rates of
change in different dimensions of poverty. Their potential for
capturing human as well as household poverty characteristics is
valuable in contexts where gender differentials and the more qualitat
ive aspects of poverty are considered in1portant. However, a concep
tual framew<>rk is still necessary if the indicators are to be selected on a
theoretically informed, rather than an ad hoe, basis.
Poverty as 'Ends': A Basic Needs Perspective
·rhe idea that the 'means' available to the poor - as measured by their
purchasing power - can be separate<i from their 'ends' - the

satisfaction of basic needs - stems from the belief that whatever these
needs are, they can be satisfied through a sufficient level of purchasing
power. Purchasing power can therefore be taken as an adequate index
of needs satisfaction. However, this is premissed on a very narrow
interpretation of need. In its most reductionist version, it refers only to
the imperatives of physiological survival. This is the view embedded in
many versions of the poverty line which define the poor as those who
are not able to cover their basic calorie needs. However, basic needs
can be given a wider range of different meanings than the ability to
purchase a minimum recommended daily allowance of calories.
Human need is about more than physiological survival; it is also about
living a healthy active life and participating in the life of the
community. These are the 'beings and doings' that people value and
that Sen ( 1987) calls 'agency achievements'. A more inclusive defini
tion of basic needs would therefore encompass culturally defined
levels of physical well-being (health, housing, clothing, sanitation)
while a still broader definition results if the concept is stretched to
cover the more intangible aspects of deprivation - powerlessness,
dependence, isolation (Chambers, 1988).
As a preliminary hypothesis derived from his own research,
Chambers ( 1988) suggests the idea of a 'hierarchy of basic needs'
among the poor in the sense that basic survival needs have to be
1
satisfied before security, and then self esteem, can become important.
My own field investigations offer a different perspective on this
proposition. In the words of one of the women I interviewed:
What need have the poor for self-respect or propriety. Everything is
dictated by scarcity [abhab]: scarcity of food, scarcity of clothes. scarcity of
shelter, there is no end to the scarcity ... there are mothers who cannot
feed their children, can they afford propriety?
Her statement conveys the clear message that for those living on the
margins of physical survival, the struggle to stay alive appears to be an
overriding priority. However, it also contains the suggestion that for
poor women, the notion of self-esteem itself might be more closely tied
to the ability to feed their children than to middle-class ideals of female
propriety, which would hamper their survival strategies.
Conflicting notions of self-esteem were also evident in the different
responses to the attempts of a development project in one of the
villages I visited to provide landless women with earth-cutting and
other non-traditional forms of work. According to the village mattabars
(leaders), the spectacle of women from 'their' village engaging in
public forms of manual labour would bring shame on the community.

A few husbands also objected to their wives joining the project, using
arguments ah<>ut their own self-esteem and honour. For many landless
won1en, however, the pr~ject offered a route to independent resources
and they chose to defy both village opinion and their husbands'
threats. In speaking, therefore, of self-esteem and autonomy as 'basic'
human needs, it is important to remember that such needs are S<x.ially
constituted and cannot be assigned a priori meanings. Poor " ·on1en
may value self-esteem and autonon1y, but define it very differenth·
both from n1en in their own households and from women from more
prosperous households.
If these less tangible aspects of well-being are taken into account, i1
bec<>mes clear that n1eans and ends are no longer separable. Different
ways of ensuring command over material resources are likely to rar~·
different implications f<>r poor people's self-esteem and autonomy:
and there may be gender differences in what these implications are.
But these cannot be assun1ed. 'J' he assessrnent of poverty must
therefore make space for considering the extent to which the tangible
and intangible basic neecis of the poor women and men are met.
Poverty as Mean•; The Entitlements Perspective
·1' he idea of entitlements comes fron1 Sen ( 1982b) and draws attention
the different basis of claims on resources which prevail in a society.
LO
·rhe distribution of resour<:es in any society occurs through a complex
system of clain1s, which are in turn embedded within the social
relations and practices that govern possession, distribution and use in
that society (Sen, 1982b). Poverty occurs because the value of the two
main parameters - endowments and exchange entitlements - that
constitute the basis of h<>usehold or individual claims to the social
product is not sufficient to cover basic needs. While entitlements
pertain to individualized con1n1and over resources, the literature on
poverty in Bangladesh suggests that it has a structural basis. The
prevailing distribution of entitlements emerges out of institutional
processes which effectively 'disenfranchise' certain groups from parti
cipating in decisions about entitlements and hence from challenging
their distribution (Appadurai, 1984 ). The causes of poverty are
theref<>re not simply a question of inadequate entitlements, but also of
structurally reproduced distributional inequities. There is an extens
ive class analysis of in1poverishment and polarization in rural Bangla
desh (Hossain, 1987; North-South Institute 1985; Rahman, I 986a.
1986b); far less attention is given to gender-based forms of disenfran
chisment and poverty (see Feldman and McCarthy, 1984; and Adnan,

1988 for some exceptions). In the discussion that follows, the social
relations of gender are considered at least as significant as those of
poverty and class in generating entitlement inequities.
Sen's concern with the legalistic basis of entitlements (the formal
rules that govern who can have the use of what) in his earlier work led
him to overlook the very different basis of claims which were inscribed
in what we discussed as the 'implicit contracts' of intra-household
relations in Chapter 4. This was rectified in a later paper (Sen, 1990)
where the concept of entitlements was extended to encompass those
intra-household distributional processes which rest on 'perceived
legitimacy' - norms and conventions - rather than legally binding
contracts. These extended entitlements have a special significance for
women in a country like Bangladesh, where they are in effect classified
as dependent minors along with children, and their welfare entrusted
to male guardians and breadwinners. Powerful beliefs and practices,
sanctioned by the norms of religion and community, produce a highly
unequal division of social and economic space. Women's ability to
mobilize resources, including their own labour power, independently
are severely curtailed. Instead, their claims to the means by which they
meet their basic needs are embedded to a large degree within the
contractual relations of family and kinship. Even when women have
apparently independent entitlements, for instance through ownership
of assets or sale of their labour power, they prefe r to realize them in
ways that do not disrupt kin-ascrihed entitlements, their primary
S<>urce of survival and security.
'fhe gender dimension of poverty occurs, therefore, because
women and men experience poverty differently and unequally. They
are also likely to become impoverished through processes that
sometimes (though not always) diverge. Conceptually, there are two
distinct processes by which women become impoverished. l 'hey can
become poorer along with the rest of the family-based household
through a deterioration in its collective entitlements; in such cases
women's interests are bound up with the collective interests of the
household. Alternatively, they can become poorer with the breakdown
of the family unit itself, and with it the 'accepted legitin1acy' of their
specific claims. Here situations may emerge where women's interests
diverge from, and may indeed conflict with, those of male members of
the household. Empirically, these different processes are closely
intertwined; the impoverishment of a household is often accompanied
by the simultaneous disintegration of its 'core' family structures and
the erosion of women's normative claims on their kin.
'fhe starting point for our framework for analysing poverty is,
consequently, that ends and means are interrelated. We therefore

Gender and Basic Needs: Food Security
Sc\'ere physical deprivation is at the core of p<>verty in Bangladesh. 11
takes the forn1 of chronic n1alnutrition, widespread hunger and lo"·
levels of life expectancy. In ,nost studies of J>overty. nutritional status
is taken as an unequivocal state1nenl about the level of individual "'·ell
being. l)ata on nutritional status among the rural population in
Bangladesh indirate the 1nagnitude of the pr<>blem. Only 5 per cent of
the population consun1e an adequate quantity and quality of food.
while 58 per cent of the rural p<>pulation suffer from long-tern1
n1alnutritic>n (UN l<.:EF, I 987). · rhe centrality of this din1ension in
cletern1ining absolute deprivation suggests that it will also be a critical
area in which to l<>Cate and understand female poverty.
Nutritional indicators, like indicators in general, are only as reliable
as their underlying assumpti<>ns. ·rhe earlier belief that all human
beings have a predetern1ined minin1um level of nutritional require
n1ents (n1oditied by such variables as activity levels, pregnancy.
breastfeeding. and so on) is being challenged by n1ore recent argu
n1en1s that populations are able to 'adapt' to low energy intake (see
Payne and Cutler. 1984 ). While there is no conclusive evidence in
favour of either p<>sition, the relationship between sever, malnutrition
and increased risk of morbidity and n1ortality is not an issue. Bearin~
these caveats in mind, a brief account of the available evidence is
presented.
One set of evidence relates to dietarv intake vis-a-vis recommended

estimates of minimum requirements which rely, among other things,
on body weight and activity levels, tend in the case of women to
inc<>rporate and reproduce past nutritional discrimination and are,
furthermore, based on unreliable estimates of women's activity levels
(Chen et al., 1981). Consequently, findings from the 1981-82 Nutri
tion Survey that there is a female disadvantage at adult ages 'only' in so
far as the higher calorie requirement of pregnant and lactating women
is not met (Mahmud and Mahmud, 1985) may underestimate the real
levels of female malnutrition. Nevertheless, as the authors point out,
the findings still suggest significant fem ale disadvantage in a context
where two-thirds of women in the reproductive ages (15-45) are
pregnant, lactating or both. A major cause of female malnutrition in
Bangladesh is therefore the superimposition of early, frequent and
closely spaced child-bearing on already high levels of malnutrition.
Aside from pregnant and lactating women, the other category which .
suffers severe nutritional disadvantage is the young, especially young
girls. The Nutrition Survey of 1985-86 provides anthropometric
evidence of widespread chronic and acute malnutrition among rural
children (58 per cent and 8 per cent). Both problems affected girls
more frequently than boys (UNICEF, 1987). Fifty-nine per cent of
girls and 56 per cent of boys suffered chronic malnutrition, while I 0
per cent of girls and 7 per cent of boys suffered acute malnutrition. A
more recent national survey conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies (BIDS) found that there has been a significant
improvement in the average weight of boys during the eighties, but
little improvement for girls (Choudhury, 1991 ).
While the most pressing reason for widespread malnutrition in
Bangladesh is 'simply that people do not have enough food' (UNICEF,
1987, p. 36), the interpretation of female malnutrition is complicated
by the interaction between gender and economic factors. Practices
which lead to inequitable gender distribution of food in the family
include feeding males first, particularly adult males, and giving them
the chc,icest and largest servings. The norms and values justifying such
dietary practices are subscribed to by both men and women and reflect
cultural beliefs about the relative needs and contributions of different
household members, fears about the consequences of violating
accepted practices, and ideologies of female altruism and
self-sacrifice:

Inequities in the intra-household distribution of resources are not
confined to the p<><>r, but operate in a n1odified form across the
economic spectrum giving gender a significance independent of class.
'fhus, while n1alnutrition decreases as family income and mothers·
education rise (UNICEF. 1987), the disadvantages associated with
gender and age persist. Data on calorie intake vis-a-vis requirements

households, while fen1ale adults suffer from larger deficits (relative

male adults) in the poorest and enjoy smaller surpluses in the richest
householcts (Mahmud and Mahmud, 1985).
It is clear that in the narrowest sense of basic needs, women suffer
deprivation to a greater extent than nlen within households. However,
food is as much about security and status as it is about shortfalls in
calorie consumption. A great deal can be learnt about household
poverty by comparing the source.frequency and c011lenl of meals. Where
a household can rely on a stable, reliable and well-established bundle
of entitlements, the acquisition of fcx>d is unlikely to require a great
deal of management or foresight. A different picture prevails a1nong

their next meal is coming from. Here considerable ingenuity and
effort is spent, f requenlly by women, to stretch out the meagre
resources available to the household. Womt'.n's activities in this area
include, for instance, gleaning the fields after the harvest; gathering
edible wild plants, fuel and fodder from common property reserves;
negotiating and begging rice or lentils from neighbours; bringing
home the discarded stalks and leaves of vegetables from the kitchens
of wealthier households. Another aspect of women's contribution is
the practice among labouring women who receive meals as part of
their wages to share it with their children, either taking their children
along to the employer's house or bringing the meal home. This does
not occur as frequently among male labourers paid in the same way.
One explanation offered was that it was considered too revealing of
their poverty and therefore demeaning to their role as breadwinners.
Diversity of diet also enters into social definitions of well-being. Food
occupies an important role in the social life of rural communities and
there is a distinct hierarchy of preference for different kinds of food.
Rice, especially the finer grain variety, is generally preferred to rooti
(wheat-based bread) as the staple item in the daily diet. Most other
items can be placed on a scale from 'luxury' or 'status' foods to 'famine'
or 'poverty' foods. Meat and certain larger varieties of fish can only be
afforded by affluent sections of the community. Chicken used to be
considered the ultimate status food (Aziz, 1979) and the only one
prestigious enough to offe r a visiting son-in-law. Similarly, consump
tion of cigarettes (rather than biris, hand-rolled tobacco leaves) and tea
with sugar and milk is also more common among affluent house
holds. 3 Poverty diets, on the other hand, include various wild plants, -
lwlmi saag (an aquatic plant); shapla (water hyacinth) stems; young jute
leaves; the fleshy trunk of the banana tree; bon lwchu (wild arum) -
many of which can be gathered from common property reserves. Very
frugal meals such as rice with chillies and salt alone, a gruel made with
rice and the water in which it is cooked, rice cooked only with lentils
(no oil or spices), also make up the diet of the poor. Finally, frequency
of meals per day is a particularly stark indicator of food security. l 'he
poor can seldom afford more than two meals a day, the very poor
make do with one. In a village study conducted in 1980, I found that
63 per cent of landless households ate two or fewer meals a day
compared to 30 per cent of households owning at least half an acre of
land. (Kabeer, 1986). In the 'hungry' months, some of the poor report
going to bed without eating all day, perhaps chewing on tobacco or
betel leaves or drinking water to blunt their hunger.
Age and gender differentials in food indicators can arise because
meals are acquired through different sources or because of straight-

Gender and Basic Needs: Health
·rhe issue of heahh graphically illustrates the artificiality of separating
n1eans and ends in the analysis of development problems. As
Chambers puts it, ··rhe n1ain asset of rnost poor people is their bodies'
( 1989, p. 4). (:onsequently, p<>verty can be seen both in terms of
shortfalls in basic bcxlily needs as well as in the ability to translate
labour endown1enls into adequate con1111and over resources. LO\\'
levels of heahh and nutrition reduce labour prc>ductivity, which in
turn devalues returns to labour and future capacity to i111prove
physical well-being. Bodily well-being is thus simultaneously means
and ends.
Although heahh is the key to proouctivity arnong the p<>0r, they are
least likely lo enjoy it. As a UN l(:~:F report observes, 'In reviewing the

precipitated into this form of labour by the illness of a male
breadwinner (Chen and Ghuznavi, 1979).
There is evidence of gender discrimination in access to health care.
For instance, Chen et al. ( 1981) show that boys are more likely to be
brought in to clinics and hospitalized than girls, despite equal
incidence of infection and the availability of free clinical care in the
area under study. According to another study (Sabir and Ebrahim,
1984), equal proportions of boys and girls were afflicted with
diarrhoea, but 66 per cent more boys than girls were taken to health
facilities for treatment.
Gender differentiates the link between health and poverty in other
ways. While child-bearing in itself may be considered a 'normal'
biological event for most rural women, it can have fatal consequences
when it is juxtaposed with women's disadvantaged access to nutrition
and health care. Maternal mortality in Bangladesh is among the
highest in the world (around five to seven per thousand live births) and
accounts for nearly a third of deaths among women in their reproduct
ive years (Chen et al. 1974). There are other more hidden mechanisms
at work. Maternal mortality rates are highest among the so-called 'poor
reproducers'. These are women who have not been successful in
producing a live birth or healthy children, particularly healthy sons,
and who are usually under intense pressure to undergo a succession of
closely spaced births; as Mahmud and Mahmud point out, 'in a woman
who is undernourished and anaemic to begin with, this can create a
life-threatening condition leading to premature death' (Mahmud and
Mahmud, 1985, p. 17).
Cumulative discrimination against women probably underlies their
lower life expectancy relative to men. The effects of discrimination
begin early. In their study of mortality differentials, D'Souza and Chen
( 1980) demonstrate that female biological advantage is only evident in
the first month after birth, when it may be assumed that social
discrimination has not yet had effect. By the end of the first year, the
biological pattern is reversed. In the first four years of life, half as
many more girls are likely to die as boys. In fact, apart from death by
drowning, UNICEF notes that girls in this age group accounted for a
greater number of deaths from all other causes. Female mortality
exceeds male in almost all subsequent age groups, thereby reversing
the phenomenon of higher female life expectancy found in most other
countries (Sen, 1990).
'fhere is one other route through which a gender dimension in basic
health needs is manifested. It relates to the question of perception. A

Gender and Basic Needs: Personal Security
Vulnerability, along with deprivation, is endemic to poverty. It may
take n1any different forrns but is often associated with the trade-offs
that poor people are often forced to ,nake in order to survive.
Frequently. the struggle f<>r survival and security can only be assured
at the expense of autonomy and self-reliance; for example, many poor
fan1ilies are forced to become clients of powerful local patrons,
offering loyalty and unpaid labour in return for protection and
assistance in times of crisis. Furthermore. the intense competition for
scarce and dwindling resources, combined with struggles for economic
and political power among a sn1all group of wealthy landlords, give
rise to situations of random as well as systematic violence between
different competing factions where it is the poor who are most
frequently the victims.
,·he vulnerability of the poor stemming from various class-based
antagonisms has received some attention in the literature (BRAC,
1980; Hartmann and Boyce, 1983). It is manifested in the police
harassments, property feuds, false litigations, forcible evictions, extor
tion, assault and sometimes murder, all of which are more likely to
characterize the lives of poor people and reinforce their dependency
on more powerful sections of the community. The ability to manipu
late, as well as violate, community norms and customs adds to the
control exercised by these sections over the lives and choices of poor
people. 'fhus in one case, powerful neighbours bent on driving a
widow. living on her own, from her land, were able to harass her by
letting loose their livestock on her homestead plot; in another case, a
landless women was beaten and had her goats confiscated by a local
landlord who claimed they had wandered into his fields.

specifically gender-based forms of vulnerability that affect women. In
particular, questions of sexual harassment of women and domestic
violence have barely been touched on, although they were repeatedly
refe rred to in my interviews and conversations with village women.
Consequently their link with poverty can only be speculated on here.
Vulnerability to sexual harassment and domestic violence is an aspect
of the gendered nature of poverty because poor women, in particular,
are most exposed to the risk of harassment and least able to remove
themselves from violent situations. Women may have to stay with
violent husbands, or accept sexual abuse from their employers,
because the alternatives to such behaviour are even more bleak. It is
also the case that women who move in 'public space' are perceived to be
transgressing the boundaries of female propriety and are therefore a
sexual provocation, to be teased, harassed or assaulted. Poorer women
and girls are least able to afford to remain within the shelter of the
homestead or to purchase forms of transport that would maintain
their purdah, and are consequently most exposed to harassment by
strangers. Moreover, in a society where family honour is linked to the
virtue of its female members, sexual harassment and rape are often
used in property feuds and factional disputes to humiliate opponents.
Domestic violence against women (and children) is also a widespread
but poorly documented phenomenon. Husbands figured most fre
quently in my interviews as the perpetrators, but brothers, uncles and
sons were also mentioned. Conflicts over resource distribution often
sparked off these incidents. Food-related conflicts have already been
noted; women also reported beatings when they refu sed to sell their
patrimonial property at their husband's insistence; an orphaned girl
was beaten by her uncle when she asked for her share of fruits from
family-owned trees. Harassment and sometimes murder of women
also occurred over dowry-related conflicts.
The incidence of violence, particularly domestic violence, is of
course extremely sensitive information and difficult to collect. How
ever, a record of the number of suicides, murders, sexual assaults and
'unnatural' deaths in an area may help to provide at least some
indication of the link between poverty and gender-specific forms of
violence. Certainly there is some 'anecdotal' and some statistical
evidence to suggest that women's experience of personal insecurity
may differ significantly from that of men and may need to be given
specific recognition in the documentation of poverty. A few examples
of this evidence are cited below.
A village study by Hartmann and Boyce (1983) points out what
many village-level development workers can confirm: that the list of

villages in Bangladesh is predominantly female. When violence and ill
treatment are persistent features of a woman's life, suicide represents
final escape and 'tragic revenge' (p. 97). Blanchet ( 1988) cites a study
from l\-1atlab thana in Bangla<lesh which found that 'violent deaths in
women <>f reproductive age is highest for unmarried girls. ..• the first
cause being complication of induced abortions. followed by suicide
and homicide. There are indications that suicide and homicide in this
age group are often associated with illegitimate pregnancy and rape'
(p. 7). Another micr,,-level study, this time based on interviews with
prostitutes in Dhaka city. found that they were disproportionately
drawn f ron1 the p<>verty-stricken rural districts of Bangladesh and that
forty-five of sixty prostitutes interviewed reported rape, divorce or
remarriage by husbands. allegations of immorality by neighbours. or
sale into prostitution, as the major factors behind their entry into the
brothels (NORAD, 1988).
In terrns of larger-scale statistical data, a noteworthy finding from
BIDS study of rural p<>verty relates to perceptions of injustice
reported by women and men (Rahman, 1991 ). The form of injustice
most frequently reported by men was 'physical insecurity': 49 per cent.
compared with 36 per cent among women. For women, the most
frequently reported form of perceived injustice was 'immorality' (42
per cent co,npared to 22 per cent of the n1en). As the study notes,
won1en's c<>ncern with immorality as an issue of insecurity reflects the
fact that they are most often the victims of it. Also worth noting are the
findings <.>f the Governn1ent of Bangladesh Statistical Bureau ( 1992)
whose sex-disaggregatect data on causes of mortality in Bangladesh
show that 'unnatural deaths' was the single greatest cause of death
among adult won1en, higher even than maternal mortality. and higher
than the equivalent figure for men. Unfortunately, the category
'unnatural deaths' does not distinguish between suicide and n1urder,
on the one hand, and burns, poison, drowning, snakebites and
accidents, on the other. l ' he information provided by both these
national statistical surveys is consequently limited by the highly
aggregated nature of the categories used.''
Gender and Labour-Bued Entitlements
We have so far focused on the 'needs' aspects of poverty. A focus on
entitlements shifts our attention from the manifestations of poverty to
its causes. In particular, it spells out in greater detail the range of
opti<>ns that p<>or women and men have access to and helps to explain
Google Original from

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIABEYOND TIIE POVERTY LINt: 151
gender differences in the regimes of risk and vulnerability that were
touched on in the preceding section.
As noted earlier, the primary cause of poverty in rural Bangladesh is
the absence of any entitlement to the social product, other than what
can be acquired through the use of unskilled labour power. Gender is
relevant here because it differentiates both the conditions under which
men and women can dispose of their labour and the returns to their
labour power. Men dispose of their labour in a variety of ways, but are
able to orient most of their effort to income-earning activities.
Women's ability to dispose of their labour power is constrained within
the narrower parameters imposed by purdah and by their domestic
obligations, is less likely to be remunerated, and generally receives
lower returns when it is. National data show that women earn 40 per
cent of the wage rate earned by men (Rahman and Sen, 1993).
One of the characteristics of poor households is the existence of
multiple earners - women, men, the old and the young- and often in
multiple occupations, since no single occupation is stable enough or
well-paid enough to guarantee the household an adequate livelihood.
Women's participation in income-earning activities need not violate
purdah norms, since many forms of income earning can be carried out
within the homestead precincts. Cultivation of the homestead plot and
livestock rearing are common examples. The practice of 'share
rearing' allows poor women to transform their only resource, labour
power, into a productive asset. By this arrangement, they rear livestock
and poultry on behalf of wealthier households. This entitles them to
keep every alternate offspring or half the profits from sale of stock.
Purdah can also be preserved when income is earned on a putting-out
basis. In some districts, the local tobacco industry employs women to
roll cigarettes on a piece-rate basis in their homes. Elsewhere, women
are supplied by local subcontractors with palm leaves which they weave
into mats, returning one mat in every two and selling the other
themselves. Similar arrangements operate for other craft products:
quilts, jute goods, and so on.
Performing domestic chores and post-harvest processing of crops in
wealthy households is considered an acceptable form of wage labour
for women because it is still homestead based. However, the value of
returns on this activity is diminishing because increasing numbers of
women are competing for employn1ent in a field where opportunities
are being eroded by the spread of mechanized milling. 5 While meals
still constitute a common form of remuneration, the amount and
quality of food offered has deterioration: the previous custom of
allowing women to eat a 'full stomach' worth of rice is giving way to
predetermined quantities; rooti (less preferred wheat-based bread) is

The erosion of employ1nent opportunities through n1echanization

·rhe restructuring of 1he gender division of labour and the increasing
presence of women in areas of work outside the boundaries of purdah
have contradictory implications for women's well-being. On one hand,
it might be argued that purdah is still a powerful norm, so that public
forms of physical labour are associated with considerable stress, shame
and insecurity for women. 'l'he presence of won1en in brickfields. road
construction and bazaars is generally indicative of 'distress sales of
labour' (1':lsc>n, 1988b), since they will enter such public forn1s of
manual lal><>ur onlv under extren1e economic stress. On the other
,
hand, since it is precisely the ideology and practice of purdah that
creates and legitin1ates women ·s material dependence. there is an
emancipatory potential to their en1ergence from seclusion and entry
into segments of the labour market hitherto barred to them. It gives
them access, perhaps for the firs time in their lives, to entitlements
I
other than those associated with socially ascribed relations of
dependence.

'fhe contradictory effects of social change serve as an important
remainder that the relationship between income and well-being
contains subjective evaluations as well as financial considerations. For
example, outdoor, manual or 'dirty' work, hired status, arbitrary,
casual or personalized terms of employment, are all qualities that are
generally less valued by both men and women than 'clean', indoor or
desk jobs, self-employed status, and secure, well-defined conditions of
employment. Many landless households prefer to trade off the higher
earnings from agricultural wage labour for the greater independence
associated with farming sharecropped land. Evaluation of employ
ment options for women is likely to be more complex because purdah
norms link their social status (and that of their kin) with their public
invisibility. Certainly most of the women interviewed expressed a
preference for home-based activities because of their compatibility
with purdah norms. Nevertheless, there were noteworthy exceptions
to the general rule, which suggested that below a certain level of
poverty, or among women who had already made the break with
purdah, considerations of convenience, the demands of the work and
financial gain, similar to those which concern n1en, become
predominant.
Gender and Capital-Based Entitlements
Capital is used here in the broad sense to encompass tangible and
intangible assets which embody claims on future consumption. Land
remains the most important tangible asset in a predominantly agrarian
economy, enabling command over different types of resources. It
enhances a household's productive base, and hence its capacity to meet
its longer-term consumption requirements, as well as offering the
possibility of meeting more immediate needs. However, poverty
highlights the potential f ungibility of most objects, and there are a
wide range of household possessions - productive assets as well as
consumer items-which can also serve to secure basic needs among the
landless through pawning, exchange, sale or as a collateral in times of
. .
cr1s1s.
The constraints on women's mobility and earning power described
above also limit their ability to purchase assets or raise credit. Their
main access to tangible property is through kinship entitlements:
inheritance and marriage gifts. Daughters inherit land, though less
land than sons, under Islamic law. However, women seldom enforce
their entitlement to land, prefe rring to waive it in favour of their
brothers in exchange for a claim to their protection in case of

the l<>cal elite who have city houses and political connections and may
even belong 10 the institutional h<>dies that distribute public sector
credit: 'illiterate, ill-<:lad cultivators 1nust argue their case in to\\·n

Whitehead ( 1985) points out. the 'contractual inferiority' in the capital
n1arket whic·h characterizes the relations of poorer peasants to richer
ones is also likely to characterize those between poor women and elite
n1ale officials. (~ender-hased 'contractual inferiority' in rural Bangla

standing practice among rural women to keep aside a 'fistful' of
uncooked rice, often clandestinely, every day before the main meal.
This builds up into a small but important savings fund and forms the
basis of informal borrowing and lending activities within the neigh
bourhood. These networks are the source of important intangible
resources for women since they provide them with contacts, informa
tion and security in the absence of access to formal credit institutions.
However, the plight of the ultra-poor in the sphere of credit was
summed up by a young girl from an all-female household: 'We don't
dare to take loans from anybody, because we know we could never pay
them back'.
Gender and Household-Based Entitlements
'J'he ideologies, norms and practices embodied in the 'implicit'
contracts of household and kinship relations interlock to produce a
situation where women's control over material assets and labour
power, including their own, and their ability to n1obilize resources
outside the household, are severely curtailed. Women's experience of
poverty is differentiated from that of men as a result of this asymmetry
in their entitlement systems. Implicit household-based contracts are
neither symmetrically distributed nor legally enforceable. Women's
claims to support and shelter consequently tend to be normative,
embedded to a large extent in socially ascribed obligations associated
with marriage, family and kinship. This is in contrast to n1ale
entitlements, which have a material base. Even men who have no assets
to their name have at least the freedom to sell their labour power to the
highest bidder, unconstrained by the ideological boundaries of pur
dah. There is therefore a fundamental asymmetry in the distribution
of material and normative entitlements within the household: 'male
authority has a material base, while male responsibility is normatively
controlled. Normative control, while powerful, is nevertheless relat
ively malleable in the face of economic necessity' (Cain et al., 1979,
p. 410).
The gender asymmetry in entitlements and claims has various
repercussions. The data on nutrition and health status within the
household already cited suggest that the distribution of resources does
not correspond to the actual needs of members. Instead it appears to
be determined by the individual's position in the various intersecting
hierarchies of age, gender and kinship status which characterize
household relations. Inequalities in the distribution of material
entitlements consequently translate into inequalities in the satisfaction

of basic needs. Furthern1<,re, asymmetrical entitlements produce
in1p<>rtant difference in the trajectories by which different categories
of househ<>ld n1e1nbers becon1e p<><>rer. The gender dimension in
poverty pr<>cesses stems from women's limited access to material
entitlements and their disprop<>rtionate dependence on normative
ones. The failure to n1ake a successful transition from the status of
daughter to wife to n1other, each status bearing specific claims on a
male guardian and breadwinner. entails a specific diminution of
women's econon1ic and social well-being. ·rhe death of a husband. for
instance, can precipitate an abrupt descent into poverty for a woman if
there are no surviving adult sons to take over her protection and
support.
Marriage itself is becon1ing a less secure option for women: 'the
normative obligations of n1en toward wo1nen - the principal protec
ti<>n won1en have against loss of status - have probably never been
universally honoured, but there are indications that under the
pressure of increasing poverty, male normative commitment has
er<>ded' ((:ain et al., 1979, p. 408). ·rhere is now a greater tendency
an1ong n1en, particularly p<><>rer men, to walk out of n1arriages. thus
abdicating their financial resp<>nsibility to dependent wivt>s and
chilclren. A variety of sources attest to the strains placed on familial
obligations in the process of irnpoverishment. Development workers
in one district spoke of 'seasonal divorce', referring to the increase in
the incidence of desertions in the hungry season, while a number of
writers have note<I the higher rate of divorce and desertions an1ong
p<><>r and landless groups (Miranda. 1982; Chaudhury and Ahmed,
1980; Kabeer, 1985). My own study found that the single most
in1portant reason given by women for marital dissolution was the
failure of husbands to feed their wives, that is, the collapse of conjugal
entitlements (Kabeer, 1985) .
l 'he growing numbers of female heads of households are also
indicative of the erosion of n1ale normative commitment. Micro-level
and national statistics dc>eun1ent this departure from the social norm
of patriarchally organized households and establish its links with
poverty (Cain et al., 1979; Kabeer, 1985; Alarn, 1985). The 1981
Population Census and the Agricultural Sector Review (Safilios
Rothschild and Mahmud, 1989) bc>th showed that 15 per cent of rural
households were fen1ale headed, while the latter also noted that the
incidence of female headship was highest among the landless (25 per
cent) and diminished with increasing landholdings. The BIDS study
(Hamid, 1991) cited earlier found that while 8 per cent of male-headed
households fell into the category of 'hard core poverty', the figure for
Google Original from

female-headed households was 33 per cent. Moreover, female-headed
households had an income which was on average 40 per cent below
that of male-headed households.
A final observation relevant to the breakdown of normative entitle
ments is the increasing significance of migration, both permanent and
temporary, as a component in household survival strategies. The
poverty dimension in migration patterns is revealed in various studies;
its direction is generally from poorer districts of Bangladesh to more
prosperous rural areas, or else to the urban conglomerations, where
employment opportunities might be higher (see Rahman et al., 1987).
Migration rates were also found to be higher among landless house
holds, particularly during the famine of 1974 (Rahman et al., 1987). In
earlier national statistics, female migration appeared primarily as a
result of women moving at marriage to their husbands' villages.
Independent female migration was rare. The increased presence of
women in the urban areas documented in the 1974 Census was
dismissed as the product of better coverage than earlier censuses,
though it did not exclude 'greater female migration to cities to join
their husbands'. However, smaller-scale studies in urban slums and
brothels (Farouk, 1976; NORAD, I 988) show that a significant
proportion of recent migrants were divorced/deserted women from
poor rural families who sought employment in towns because of its
greater acceptability and availability compared to rural areas. Detailed
migration data from one area in Bangladesh estimated that independ
ent female migration, in pursuit of livelihood strategies or subsequent
to marital dissolution, constituted nearly a third of all female mig
ration (Matlab Surveillance System, 1979). The rise of independent
female migration, like the emergence of female-headed households,
can be taken as signalling both household and female pauperization
because it signifies the breakdown of family-based entitlements and
impinges most severely on women and their dependents.
There do not appear to be any studies in Bangladesh that seek to
establish what migration might mean in the lives of the poor in
general, and for poor women in particular. However, qualitative
evidence from India testifies to the disruption and insecurity it creates
in the lives of those who have to resort to migration. Using participa
tory appraisal techniques, Meera Shah reports how women described
the experience of having to work as migrant casual labour for a few
months every year: 'they had no place to stay and would camp in
different places, carrying the barest of necessities with them, and most
of the time slept under the open sky' ( 1993, p. 10). Mazumdar ( 1989)
also reports how migrant women agricultural labourers in West

ration was resorted to only in conditions of extreme distress since it
entailed long journeys in extrernely arduous circumstances, sexual
harassment by employers or their recruiting agents, search for
temporary shelter and highly exploitive conditions of work, c-ompared

factor differentiating the processes hy which women and men becorne
poor.
One feature of household-coping strategies noted by l)reze ( 1988) is
the precedence given to the protection of the long-run productive base

of the household over short-term consumption standards. Widely
reported as a first response to crisis by those interviewed was greater
austerity in consumption: reducing the amount of food and number of
meals consumed daily, letting illnesses go untreated and huts unre
paired. This is frequently accompanied or followed by other strat
egies: intensifying income-earning efforts, going into debt, or turning
to neighbourhood networks. In a persisting crisis, a gradual divest
ment of assets takes place in order of their dispensability to household
survival and security; non-productive assets tend to be disposed of
before productive ones. Land is generally held on to as long as
possible, final dispossessions being postponed through mortgaging
arrangements. Ownership of homestead land has an independent
significance for the poor, since it offers scope for productive effort and
also anchors the household unit to a stable place in the community. Its
loss propels f amity members into the ranks of the floating and rootless
poor and may be the beginning of the disintegration of the core fa mity
.
unit.
At some stage in the divestment process, members of the household
who are not normally in employment - women, the very old and the
very young- will be forced into seeking their own livelihood. The final
stages of impoverishment are characterized by desertions and crisis
migrations, along with the visible breakdown of the 'moral economy' of
rights and obligations which bind the family unit together. Able
bodied male earners become increasingly reluctant to shoulder the
burden of non-earning dependents. They are likely to be the first to
abandon the family unit, leaving women to look after the very young
and very old. At extreme levels of destitution, mothers abandon their
children in orphanages or leave them to fend for themselves in the
informal 'bazaar' economy. Thus, after the 1974 famine, women who
had been deserted by their husbands migrated to the cities and began
to fill the vagrant homes, while in one district special homes had to be
set up for deserted children (Alamgir, 1980).
As long as family-based entitlements are respected, women's inter
ests are very much bound up with the fortunes of their family unit and
they are likely to experience poverty processes in much the same way.
There are certain points, however, in the downward spiral of poverty
when conflicts become apparent between the interests of male and
female members. At such points, the manner in which conflicting
interests are resolved will critically shape women's subsequent experi
ence of the impoverishment process. For instance, the finding that
increased mortality during disaster was disproportionately experi
enced by young girls (D'Souza and Chen, 1980) suggests that the
austerity response in times of crisis is not neutrally distributed within

than on others. Demographic responses - migration or dissolution of
the fan1ily unit - often give rise to fen1ale-headed households. which
are frequently n1ore vulnerable to the risk of further impoverishn1ent.
(;ender differentials are also manifested in household divestment
strategies. As we noted earlier. divestment strategies are generally

endanger future recovery. ·rhe gender of the owner of the different
househ<>ld assets n1ay be an additional consideration in determining
the sequenre of disp<>sal. 'l"here is son1e suggestive evidence on this
p<lssibility. In his study of the Bengal fan1ine in 1943, Greenough
notes, '{)ne of the first signs of econun1ic distress in rural Bengal was
the sale of women's jewellery and ornan1ents' ( 1982, p. 197). With

tin r<x>fs all found their way into the market (Greenough, 1982, cited
in Agarwal. 1990, p. 404 n. 940) . .Jiggins has also suggested, on the
basis of case studies from Bangladesh, as well as Sri Lanka, that
'whatever won1en's personal earnings or assets, these are consumed
before the point of fan1ily breakdown' (1986, p. 14).
·rhe village interviews threw up a nurnber of exceptions to the
practice among rural women of waiving their rights to their fathers·
property in favour of their brothers. Some of the women interviewed
had been driven by family poverty or by their husband's threats to lay
clain1 to their share of the patrimonial assets. From the information
offered, it appeared that husbands frequently used the threat of
desertion to force wives to sell off their share of inherited land.
Sometimes the husbands left anyway, having appropriated the pro
ceeds of the sale. One abandoned woman had incurred her husband'!>
wrath for refusing to sell her share of land, at the same time as
alienating her brothers for agreeing to sell trees from the same piece of
land.
Acc<)rding to Jahangir ( 1986), the ideologies governing property
rights in rural Bangladesh distinguish between male property rights,
which refer to sampaiti (where ownership is en1bedded in conjugal.
familial and kinship systerns), and fen1ale property rights, which refer
to jinish (delegated, hence confiscable, rights over items or things). If
such ideologies are used to justify the sale of women's assets earlier on
in a household's divestment strategy (and we need firmer empirical
evidence on this) it means that further down the poverty spiral, when
family-based entitlements begin to break down, women have fewer
resources to fall back on than men. Their only recourse is to sell their
labour in the worst paid, highly casual and most subservient forms <lf

Conclusion
The way in which we choose to 'know' and measure poverty has
implications for how we deal with it. Our discussion of a gender
differentiated framework for analysing poverty highlights some of the
problems with more conventional approaches. First of all, focusing
solely on household-level poverty gives rise to poverty-alleviation
strategies which target only (male) heads of household, on the
assumption that the welfare of other members is thereby assured.
Second, the separation of means and ends in conventional approaches,
the preoccupation with means rather than ends, and with the physical
aspects of deprivation rather than the more intangible ones, all tend to
encourage strategies which focus only on 'efficient' delivery mechan
isms. They fail to consider that the terms on which resources are
offered have profound in1plications for people's sense of dignity and
control over their own lives.
A gender perspective on poverty reminds us that household income
cannot be equated with individual well-being. It signals the need for
the disaggregation of information and strategies in order to ensure
that poverty-reduction strategies are translated into equitable out
comes within the household. It also suggests that such a translation
requires attention to means as well as ends. A concern with gender
equity will entail recognizing that needs may be prioritized differently
by women and men and that entitlements may carry different
implications for their self-esteem and autonomy.
Expanding the definition of basic needs to include more qualitative
dimensions such as self-esteem, autonomy and participation suggests
other ways of rethinking anti-poverty strategies. ·rhese dimensions are
most likely to elude quantification and hence most likely to be
overlooked in the measurement of poverty ((:hambers, 1988). This
will have serious implications for the way in which poverty is
addressed. Tackling poverty only in its observable and n1easureable
dimensions carries the danger of leaving intact those dimensions
which arise out of the 'deep-r<><>tedness' of poverty in the social
structure. Anti-poverty strategies, to be sustainable as well as equitable,
will have to go beyond a practical concern with welfare to a more
strategic analysis of the political economy of class and gender.
However, such strategies are not easy to devise or implement. On the
policy side, they seek to address the more intangible aspects of
women's empowerment, their lack of autonomy and self-esteem,
aspects which take policy-makers well beyond routinized delivery of
welfare or income-generating resources into territory that they may be
both unfamiliar as well as uncomfortable with. On the community side,

Social Cost-Benefit Analysis
'fhe basic notion is very simple. If we have to decide whether

public de(:isio11-1nakcrs fron1 private ones. Public policy objectives
differ fron1 those of the private sector because public planners are
entrusted with ensuring the social goocl in situations where privatt
profitability considerations are unlikely to bring it about. However. it is
not sufficient for planners to have the right intentions. Like all other
actors in the e(onon1y, planners need detision-n1aking rules that help
to distinguish between efficient a1ul inefficient uses of limited
resources. As a practical appli(·ation of standard welfare econon1ics.
cost- benefit analysis ((:BA) clai1ns to provide an appropriate, coherent
and theoretically grounded set of decision-1naking rules to assist in thi~
selection process. It is now widely used in development planning to
decide whether a project is worth e1nbarking on (appraisal) or whether
it has achieved what it set out to do (evaluation).
·rhe actual guidelines vary accorcling to the particular goals that an
intervention is intended to achieve. Where the goal is fi11ancial
profitability. cost- benefit analysis requires that the market value of the
benefits that flow from a project over its life cycle exceed the market
costs of its inputs. Discount rates are used on both sets of flows to allo"'
for the fact that costs and benefits incurred in the future might be
valued differently fron1 the san1e costs and benefits incurred now: the
bird-in-hand principle. However, development planners recognize
that for a variety of reasons, private costs and benefits may diverge
significantly fron1 social costs and benefits. For instance, an economy
n1ay be protected by tariffs and subsidies from international competi
tion so that its don1estic n1arket prices do not reflect the true scarcity
value of its resources. Where foreign exchange has to be earned or
allocated in such an economy, reliance on market prices will not assure
an efficient set of choices. l 'he broader goal of economic efficiency,
rather than the narrower one of financial profitability, requires that
costs and benefits of all planned interventions are assigned 'shadow
prices' which reflect their real scarcity value, in place of imperfect
market prices which distort it. In our example, this entails using
international market prices as 'shadow' prices for all goods and
.
services.

framework still further. Pre missed on the assumption that the aim of

The Claims for SCBA: Gender and Efficiency
·rhe apparent breadth of SCBA's reach in addressing both efficiency
and equity objectives suggests that it is a promising approach to
ensuring a more central place for women's concerns in development
planning in general. Supportive measures for women, like all forms of
planned intervention, require decision rules because they use scarce
resources in order to produce desired outcomes. Interventionist
policies on behalf of women tend to fall into the domain of SCBA
because they are generally undertaken by agencies that pay at least
rhetorical attention to equity issues along with efficiency objectives.
l 'his dual concern is summarized, for instance, in a USAID position
paper on women and development, which declares:
To pursue a development planning strategy without a women in develop
ment focus would be wasteful and self-defeating - wasteful because of the
potential loss of the contribution of vital human resources and self
defeating because development which does not bring about its benefits to
the whole of society is self-defeating ( 1982, p. 2).
SCBA can be used to justify greater attention to gender issues in the
project cycle on efficiency grounds if, for instance, it can be demon
strated that market prices do not reflect the benefits produced by
women or the costs incurred by them. Any development project which
neglects either of these dimensions runs the risk of allocating
resources without due regard for the real structure of costs and
benefits. This is a point which finds a sympathetic audience in many
planning agencies. To quote USAID again, 'the misunderstanding of
gender differences, leading to inadequate planning and designing of
projects, results in diminished returns on investment' (1982, p. 3).
The efficiency case for taking gender dimensions seriously in
project planning is supported by a series of case studies that document
the failure of projects to achieve their efficiency objectives because
they neglect the gender distribution of costs and benefits. Much of this
failure was premissed on a view of the household which did not mesh
with the reality on the ground, a view rooted in the 'transcultural'
assumption of unified household decision-making promoted in ortho
dox neo-classical economics. A number of these examples have been
touched on in Chapter 4, but it is worth reiterating the underlying
policy assumptions that led to project failure. In the case of The
Gambia, between 1966 and 1980, not one but three successive groups of
foreign donor agencies (the Chinese government, the Taiwanese
gc>vernment and then the World Bank) sought and failed to bring

ah<>ut the anticipated reduction in irnported rice through the pron10-
tion of double-(ropped irriga1ed rife prc>duction. As the World Bank
reporl on this pr<~jecl ( 1977) points oul, the actual acreage (1,934
acres) of irriga1ed rice cuhivaled belween 1973 and 1975 fell well sh<lrt
of the planned acreage f<>r this perioci (3,000 acres).
L>ey's researc:h ( 1982) provides an interesting and illuminating stud,
of the assun1p1ions that underpinned this project misbehaviour. The
critical faclor lay in the planners' failure 10 recognize (a) that the local
Mandinka systen1 of righ1s and obligations required women as well as
,nen lo contribute lo 1heir family's food requiren1ents, thereby
offering the forn1er some insulation from arbitrary den1ands on their
labour lime by their husbands; and (b) that women were primarily
resp<>nsible for rice farn1ing. which they undertook on compound
holdings as well as on land they had cleared for their own use. Using a
1nisconceived rnodel of the gender division of labour and obligations
wi1hin 1he household, planners targe1ed 1heir efforts entirely al men.
giving then1 cuhivalion righ1s over 1he irriga1ed land and offering
lhem credil, inputs and exlension services. Rather than working on
newly irriga1ed ricelands where 1hey had no recognised rights, women
preferred lo clear new swan1pland plols and continue 1heir independ
enl cuhivation of rice. Consequently 1here was a shor1age of labour at
critical limes of the year, forcing many men to pay women (sometimes
their wives) wages to secure their labour inputs.
Jones's study of a World Bank project to increase irrigated rit·e
pr<>duction in (:amer<>on Uones, 1983, cited in Horenstein, 1985)
offers other examples of n1isplaced incentives in project planning.
Once again it was assumed that Massa 'household' labour would be
available to work on 1he irrigated rice fields. In this case. what the
planners overlooked were 'the traditional patterns of production and
dis1ribu1ion which denied wornen access to rice fields of their own and
control over 1he producls of 1heir lalx,ur' (Horenstein, 1985, p. 27). As
we saw in Chapter 5, in the Can1eroon case Massa women and men had

fields were alm<>sl invariably cultivated jointly by husband and wife.
with husbands conlrolling lhe disposition of the crop. Although
women working on the irrigated rice fields received some financial
compensalion for 1he labour 1hey provided to their husbands, it was
nol large enough lo persuade then1 to cultivale the additional fields
necessary to n1eet 1arge1ed output levels Uones, 1983).
A lhird example of efficiency losses through gender-biased miscon
ceptions comes from Weslern Kenya. Staudt's ( 1978) research points

n1ale and concentrated their attention on households where men were
present. While around 40 per cent of farms were female-managed,
these were consistently bypassed. Nevertheless, female farm managers
used their own information networks to increase their rates of
adoption and frequently proved to be more innovative than farms
where men were present. According to Staudt's calculations, a third of
the female-managed farms that were classified as early adopters of
hybrid maize had no administrative support or advice for such a move;
among farms with men present which had been similarly neglected,
only 3 per cent adopted early. She concluded that ignoring women's
productivity potential had slowed down the diffusion of innovative
farming practice: 'Denying access to capable groups because of norms
which support male preference represents an inefficient use of scarce
resources' (Staudt, 1978, p. 452).
The Claims for SCBA: Gender and Equity
A powerful case can also be made for the use of SCBA to promote
gender equity in development planning. The goal of gender equity has
gained an increasing legitimacy among policymakers. Empirical meas
ures show that women do less well than men according to many of the
conventional indicators of human well-being: lifetime income, nutri
tion, education, wealth and leisure (UN, 1980a; Sivard, 1985; Seager
and Olson, I 986; Buvinic et al., 1983; Folbre, 1986b; Bruce and
Dwyer, 1988). The now widely cited declaration by the UN that women
do nearly two-thirds of the world's working hours, but receive only a
tenth of its income and own less than I per cent of its wealth,
summarizes for many the case for greater gender equity in develop
ment. Since equity goals demand that specific attention be paid to the
welfare of those who are relatively worse off, large numbers of women
would qualify on these grounds to participate in development inter
ventions which help counteract gender-specific disadvantage.
SCBA, with its emphasis on equity objectives, appears particularly
appropriate in this context. The objective of i,nproving the lives and
status of women could be treated as what welfare economists call a
'merit good' - an area of activity in which the government is better
equipped than individuals or the market to act in the best interests of
society. In principle, therefore, a strong case can be made for the use
of SCBA in advocating supportive investments for women. It appears
capable of taking cognizance of both women's vital role in sustaining
economic production and the inequitable practices which prevent
them from fully sharing in the fruits of development.

unionized male workers and management in upholding the stereo
typing process in order to protect male privilege. This collusion has
meant that
the equations - men/skilled, women/unskilled - are so powerful that the
identification of a particular job with women ensured that the skill content
of the work would be downgraded. It is the sex of those who do the work,
rather than its content, which leads to its identification as skilled or
unskilled. (Phillips and Taylor, p. 85)
A study of global market factories came to the conclusion that the
widespread association between women and unskilled jobs on the
assembly line could be attributed to the fact that women enter the
labour market already determined as 'inferior bearers of labour'
rather than because they are 'bearers of inferior labour' (Elson and
Pearson, l 981, p. 150). Finally, a review of the literature on women's
employment in India and the Philippines pointed out how ascribed
characteristics like caste and gender are frequently used to screen
workers prior to more conventionally recognized devices of education
and other acquired qualifications (Kabeer, 1987). Productivity tests are
seldom carried out; rather, women and men are automatically
assigned to particular tasks and occupations on the basis of ascribed
caste and gender attributes.
To sum up, we would suggest that gender hierarchies in the
occupational structure - with women primarily 'crowded' into less well
paid, more casual and informal areas of economic activity- should not
be seen as the outcome of individual responses to impersonal market
phenomena, as many orthodox economists seem to believe. They
result from a more complex combination of factors. As Scott points
out,
the key to the segregation between male and female labour markets lies in
recruitment, but this has be conceived broadly. Several factors may be
10
involved here: the process whereby particular jobs become sex-labelled: the
effect that sex-labelling has in deterring potential applicants form applying
for jobs of the 'wrong' sex, and in creating discrimination on the part of
employers; the presence or absence of any explicit exclusionary mechan
isms; and finally, the degree to which the content of education and
vocational training is 'gendered' and therefore fails to equip women for
competition with men for 'male' jobs. (Scott, 1986, p. 355)
In the light of these findings, how reliable are wage differentials as a

opportunity costs of labour? I would argue that pervasive gender
based in1perfections in the lal><>ur n1arket have serious implications for
measuring the true productivity, opportunity costs and wage elasticit~
of male and fe1nale lal><,ur; what is even more serious is that we ha\'e
few ways of knowing what the extent of the bias is. The cleavage in tht:
labour market into 'male' and 'female' sectors leads to the persisten1
undervaluation of women's lal><,ur - and the concomitant oven·alua
ti<>n of men's - making any clear-cut comparis<>n of the true value of
labour across the sectors nearly imp<>ssible.
However, son1e suggestive estin1ates of the economic implications of
labour-market segmentation have been thrown up by simulation
exercises carried out with UK data (Tzannatos, 1988 and 1990; Pike.
1982). Assuming for the sake of the argun1ent that gender differen
tials in wages apply to otherwise indentical labour and are mtirely due
to the discrin1inatory confinement of women to a few low-paid
<>ecupations, these estimates suggest that employn1ent in male domin
ated occupations would have to increase by around a third to achieve
equality of wages. Interestingly, the findings also suggest that
competitive-lal><>ur-market outcomes would lead to significantly in
creased wages in the few previously female-dominated occupations (b)·
around 50 per cent), reduction by only a few percentage p<>ints in
previously n1ale-dominated occupations, and substantial output gains.
Similar estimates are also rep<>rted for a number of Latin American
countries (Psacharopoulos and 1·zannatos, 1991 ). As Tzannatos ( 1990)
puts it, 'There are efficiency gains to be obtained from the elimination
of crowding' (p. 200).
To return to the question of SCBA in development planning, the
problem faced derives, therefore, not so much from straightforward
discrimination (that is, unequal pay for work of equal value) as from
the creation of incommensurable for1ns of labour, the widespread
confinement of women to low-paid sectors of the economy, and the
consequent curtailment of direct competition between the sexes.
Faced with this situation, project planners have two courses of action.
They may decide to accept the given distribution of wages on the
grounds that it is the relevant n1easure of the value of labour; as
Evenson ( 1976, p. 92) suggests, 'strictures about female labour force
participation do not negate the implications of economic theory, the)·
only influence the value of women's time'. In doing so, however, they
help to preserve an inequitable status quo and probably miscalculate
the real value of production forgone through the employment of
women. On the other hand, if they decide to pay female labour on
'equitable' wage, then the elaborate process of cost-benefit analysis

1nay be rendered redundant. As we argue below, CBA has particular
difficulties in accommodating the notion of equity within its frame
work of analysis.
The Silences in SCBA: The Valuation of
Non-marketed Goods
'I"he problem of 'incommensurables' dealt with so far refers to the
problem of using market prices as the measure of value in situations of
restricted competition and segmented labour markets. Market bias
works differently when benefits or costs cannot be assigned monetary
prices because they do not enter market transactions at all. Without
monetary prices as the common numeraire, there is no meaningful
basis of comparison between costs and benefits. The issue of these non
marketed activities is not a trivial one, particularly in the Third World.
It is generally true that the poorer a nation, class or household, the
more critical is the role of self-provisioning and other non-market
activities to its survival. The gender bias to this preoccupation with
marketed goods stems from the fact that a significant proportion of
women's labour in most developing economies takes place outside the
market.
Within the general category of non-marketed goods, there are
further sub-categories. Some goods are potentially marketable; others,
however, by tMir very nature do not enter the marketplace at all. Where
the products of women's labour are at least potentially marketable (for
example, subsistence crop production, fuel and water porterage),
some form of shadow pricing may be possible - although clearly the
procedure of imputing prices on the basis of 'equivalent' activities in
gender-segmented labour markets is fraught with simplifying assump
tions and ad hoe guesstimates. 1 It is difficult, however, to imagine how
the logic of shadow pricing could be extended to won1en's labour in
activities for which markets do not exist. The most obvious example of
such labour is in the domestic reproduction, maintenance and care of
human resources: child-bearing and child care, care of the sick,
disabled and elderly, and the daily maintenance of all household
members. ·rhese activities are at least as important to household
survival and well-being as the production of material resources; but, as
we pointed out in Chapter 4, to treat them as analogous forms of
production would be to ignore the very different values that govern
them. Elson summarizes this point well when she says:

Rt::V t:RS t: I> Rt:A LITI ES
Unpaid domestic labour is not carried out entirely for love, ignoring the
econon1ic costs and benefits: but neither is it simply another economi<
activity. The process of the reproduction and maintenance of human
resources is different from any other kind of production because human
resources are treated as having an intrinsic, not n1erely an instrumental
value. Women may to some extent weigh up the costs and benefits for
1hen1selves of the an1oun1 of services they provide without pay to other
family members, but they do not regard their children as just another crop.
to he tended if the benefits are high enough. and to be left to rot untended
if the benefits become too low. (Elson, 1991 b. p. 176)
On the one hand, therefore, there are limits to how far women
then1selves will apply an econon1ic calculus in determining how much
of their time they spend in unpaid domestic labour. On the other
hand, their ability to do so is in any case constrained by the implicit
contractual obligations that characterize intra-household relations. As
we noted in (;hapter 5, n1any aspects of the gender division of labour
within the dornestic don1ain appear rernarkably resistant to change
(Folbre, 1984b; Standing. 1991 ; Beneria and Roldan, 1987). There is
little evidence to show that men take on a greater share of child care or
domestic labour when won1en increase their marketed labour. Women
are only able to participate in n1arket-oriented activities by intensifying
their overall labour effort. ·rhe 'double burden' of labour involved in
caring for the family and n1aking a living is the basis of the widespread
tinding that, on average, women work longer hours than men.
In tern1s of project design, the apparently lower opportunity costs of
women's time, as n1easured by their market wages, ignores both the
value - and the contractual basis - of their labour contributions within
the family. Developn1enl interventions premissed on the availability of
female lab<>ur time are likely to 'n1isbehave' unless they are able to
integrate a recognition of the an1ount and flexibility of women'$
domestic overheads. This is one of the points made in Leslie's revie"·
( 1992) of maternal health and fan1ily-planning provision, both ex
arnples of interventions targeted primarily at women. She cites a study
from Ethiopia hy Ayalew ( 1985) which found that failure of govern
ment health provision could be traced to the failure to understand and
accommodate women's time use within the comn1unity and suggested
that comn1unity time budget be used to address this planning
deticiency. She also notes that Coreil (1991) found that the combined
effects of maternal time constraints and absence of alternative
caretakers within the family limited women's use of child health
services, particularly those (for example, immunization) which had to
be used outside the home.

SOCIAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
The conceptual problems of integrating non-marketable
'reproductive' work into a cost-benefit framework are further com
pounded by the unreftecting biases on the part of some analysts. This
was clearly exemplified in the proceedings of a Working Group
convened in London by the Commonwealth Secretariat and WHO in
1983 to consider ways of appraising investment in supportive mea
sures for working women in developing countries. Influenced by the
apparent success of an earlier conference held in Zimbabwe in utilizing
conventional cost-benefit considerations to reinforce the case for
implementing the Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, some
members of the Working Group suggested that policy advocacy on
behalf of women would have more impact among planners if couched
in the familiar language of CBA. A paper presented earlier at the
Zimbabwe Conference advocating breast-feeding in place of bottle
feeding on the basis of costs and benefits, was circulated for the benefit
of the participants of the London Workshop (Greiner 1983, appended
in Thomas, 1984). Among the national and family-level costs of
switching from breast-feeding to bottle-feeding identified by Greiner
were the substantial extra demand for foreign exchange to cover
imports of dried milk; loss of contraceptive effect connected with
breast-feeding and resultant increase in population; impaired health
status of babies and young children as a result of early cessation of
breast-feeding, and the associated rise in health-related expenditures.
In Ghana, Greiner estimated that a reduction of only I per cent of the
estimated national annual breast-milk feeding would have cost about
US$ I million for milk powder alone, while the cost of simple
rehabilitation of even the small number of resulting cases of malnutri
tion would have probably approached USS I million. The con
sequences of women switching from breast-feeding to bottle-feeding
were spelt out in apocalyptic terms: 'Developing countries which
simply stand by and allow breastfeeding to decline in coming years will
risk economic havoc as a result' (Greiner, 1983, p. 53).
However, the case for promoting breast-feeding and the case for
supportive measures for working women are by no means parallel. As
2
Heather Joshi (1983) one of the members of the London Working
Group, pointed out, the apparent 'success' of conventional economic
considerations in reinforcing the case for promoting breast-feeding
stemmed partly from the fact that an unpriced commodity (breast
milk) was being compared with manufactured milk powder - a
product of the monetized economy and, furthermore, a 'traded' good
on which scarce foreign exchange was directly incurred. The time and
energy of the mother needed to produce breast milk was rightly or
wrongly treated as costless. The converse applied when investment in

supp<,rt rneasures for working mothers, for example, child-care
centres, was being considered. Here resources from the cash eco
nomy - investrnent in child-care centres - had to substitute for non
cash resources (narnely wornen's labour and energy) so that it was as
easy t<> rnake day care look artificially costly as it was to make bre;1st
feeding look artificially costless.
·1·he asyn1metrical evaluations of these different components -
internationally traded goods, marketed goods and non-marketable
g<x>ds - by cost-benefit analysts is linked to the point made earlier that
many aspects of women's labour, particularly those connected with
caring ancl nurturing. are so steeped in familial ideologies that their
costs and benefits are rendered invisible. (;reiner's perceptions of
breast-feeding as costless springs from such ideologies. 'Breastmilk',
according to hin1, 'is a natural resource of almost unequalled impor
tance ... It is the only food available almost equally to rich and poor
alike' (Greiner, 1983, p. 55). 'fhe consignment of breast-milk produc
tion to the realm of 'natural' activities meant, of course, that it did not
need t<> be subjected to economic analysis. Yet breast-feeding is not a
costless activity; it makes considerable de1nands on women's time and
energy. Nor does it 'cost' the sarne for rich and poor. Leslie obsen·es
that time demands of exclusive breast-feeding are undoubtedly more
intense than any other health service or health-care practice targeted
at won1en. For poorer wornen, the need to contribute to household
survival strategies n1ay necessitate long and uninterrupted hours of
absence from the hon1e, and it is not always possible for women to take
their babies with them. A study of women farn1ers in Western Nepal
found that most were unable to take their infants to the fields, because
of the steep terrain and long distances to be travelled and because of
fears about the safety of the infant (Levine, 1988, cited in Leslie, 1992).
If the nutritional demands that breast-feeding makes on \\"Ornen's
energy reserves (lactating women require a supplement of several
hundred extra calories daily to maintain their energy reserves) are
juxtaposed with the levels of malnutrition documented among poor
women in many parts of the world, then its purported 'almost equal
availability' to rich and poor women must also be juxtaposed with its
very unequal costs. As was pointed out in Chapter 5, pregnant and/or
breast-feeding women suffer from shortfalls in their nutritional
requirements in many different parts of the world, possibly because of
similar views of these aspects of their labour as costless. In fact the
World Health Organisation has pointed out, in relation to women who
are malnourished during pregnancy or whose workload is too heavy,
that 'lactation in these cases will involve the depletion of the mother's

own tissues; thus, although malnourished women can successfully
breast-feed, it is at their own expense' (WHO, 1980, p. 11 ).
A partial solution to situations where no meaningful monetary
valuation can be made of costs and benefits would be to rely on non
monetary indicators of projected benefits and use cost-effectiveness
analysis to decide how to achieve them. Social indicators, such as
reduction in infant mortality rates or increase in per-capita nutritional
intake, may serve to approximate the qualitative aspect of benefits.
However, while the use of cost-effectiveness takes care of the problem
of non-monetary benefits, the danger of treating monetized and non
monetized costs in an asymmetrical fashion still remains. Further
more, cost-effectiveness analysis is not considered as powerful as CBA
because, while it points to the least-cost method for achieving a given
objective, it is silent on whether the objective is worth the investment in
the first place (Haverman, 1976). It opens the door to subjective and
political criteria rather than depending on economic ones alone. The
assumption that CBA is somehow uncontaminated by such consid
erations is one we will return to later.
The Silences in SCBA: Pricing the 'Intangible'
·rhe difficulties we have addressed so far relate to the problem of
relying on money as the numeraire for measurement in situations
where markets either do not exist or exist imperfectly. 'fhe incorp
oration of equity objectives into cost-benefit planning raise a whole
new set of problems. The notion of equity has a far more an1biguous
status than efficiency in welfare economics, not only because it is
difficult to put a monetary value on it, but because it is often impossible
to quantify. Unlike some categories of 'incommensurables', which may
at least be approximated through qualitative indicators, there are
equity-related objectives that do not lend themselves to numerical
representation. CBA has no procedure for dealing with these 'intan
gibles'. The problem of equity tends to be resolved in SCBA by
assigning higher weighting to benefits accruing to subordinated
groups. Thus Project A may be selected over Project B because it
provides additional income to poor women. However, this is a very
conservative version of equity. SCBA would still find it difficult to
evaluate projects which tackle the underlying causes of women's lower
earnings relative to men of similar class or educational backgrounds. A
notion of equity that focuses only on outcomes, and ignores processes,
will leave intact the structural inequalities in material resources,

inequalities in earning power.
·rhere is another din1ension lo the question of 'intangibles' which
concerns values other than those of the n1arket. The disutility of
lowered consun1ption has a n1easurable component in a way that the
disutility of increased dependence does not. Yet, as we noted in the
previous two chapters, there is a considerable literature to suggest that
these intangible aspects n1atter. In fact, won1en n1ay prefer to work on

n1anaged fields, regardless of relative returns on the two activities.
because they value their autonon1y front the n1en in their households
over the prospect of enhanced household incon1e over which they had
little or no control (Jones, 1985, 1986; Dey, 1981, 1982; Jackson,
1978).
In tern1s of our earlier distin<.:tion between 'practical' and 'strategic',
planners relying on (:BA are far better at dealing with women's
practical gender interests - those arising out of their preassigned tasks
and activities within an unequal gender division of responsibilities and
resour<.:es - than with their strategic gender interests which would
require a transfor1nation of these unequal gender divisions. An added
complexity is that strategic gender interests are not always 'transpar
ent' to won1en then1selves, let alone to planners, in the way that needs
deriving f ron1 existing daily routines and responsibilities might be.
Rather, they en1erge out of a process of analysing and understanding
the structures of women's subordination in specific societies and the
strategies necessary to transform them.
If women are to increase their capacity to analyse, question and act
upon their sulx>rdination - in other words, to empower themselves -
they must be given access to the time, resources and space to do so.
Their practical needs are obviously an imp<>rtant precondition to this:
women who are overburdened with work, who must walk many miles
for clean water, or whose children are hungry are unlikely to prioritize
the longer-term pr<~ject of self-empowerment. However, the manner
in which these practical needs are addressed have in1portant implica
tions for the transformatory potential of different kinds of projects.
'fhe question of ends and means become inseparable. Women's
practical needs can be provided for in ways that leave their dependent
and subordinate status intact: income-generating projects which are
unviable without the intervention of project officials (Van der Laan
and Krippendorf. 1981 ); health-care provision offered on welfarist or
elitist principles (Shatrugna et al., 1987); or potable water distributed
through powerful members of the com1nunity (Bunch and Carrillo,
1990, p. 76). Alternatively, the needs can be addressed in ways which

equity.
Here the limitations of SCBA-defined notions of equity become
manifestly clear. Projects which seek lo address these longer-term
strategic considerations are likely to fail by SCBA standards because
the processual nature of empowerment eludes quantification. How
would one measure the costs and benefits of the strategies of
'conscientization-organization-mobilization' which a variety of grass
roots development organizations in different parts of the Third World
have adopted in response to this challenge (see Chapter 9)? How
would one measure the growth in awareness among women that
disempowering practices such as male violence, enforced child
bearing and inequalities in the distribution of resources and respons
ibilities within society are not divinely ordained or biologically deter
mined, but historically produced and hence can be challenged and
transformed? Agencies that claim to support such social action
programmes will have to plan and assess them according lo criteria
which are likely to fall outside the evaluative domain of SCBA.
The Silences in SCBA: Conflicting Interests in the
Social Welfare Function
The problems discussed so far stem from gender biases inherent in the
methodology of SCBA itself. In addition, there is a separate set of
problems that stem from the political economy within which most
SCBA exercises are conducted. It relates to the conflictual nature of
gender relations we touched on in the preceding section. SCBA is
capable of recognizing certain kinds of inequalities - namely, inequal
ities in the distribution of income in a population and the existence of
poverty groups. However, it maintains a deafening silence on the
power relations that produce these inequalities, despite the fact that
such relations persistently impinge on the interpretation of the social
welfare function. This can seriously limit the usefulness of SCBA as a
planning tool. In her critique of CBA, Stewart (1975) points to is
underlying assumption of a neutral and benign decision-maker
entrusted with the task of measuring project costs and benefits in
relation to 'the' social welfare. The question of whose interests help lo
define what constitutes the social welfare is not considered problem
atic. Yet the construction of a social welfare function is fraught with
problems if it has to accommodate heterogeneous sets of interests,
where each set of interests generates a corresponding set of shadow

prices. In pla<.:e of the unique set of values, shadow prices and

array; 'if used for proje<.:t evaluation, a different set of prc>jects would
be chosen ac(·ording to whose values, and hence which shadow prices.
were being used' (Stewart, 1975, p. 33). When there are conflicting
interests at st,1ke, overt or <.:overt struggles will ensue over whose
interpretation of the social welfare function - and hence "'·hose
values - will prevail. In the final analysis. the outcome that emerges is
unlikely to be one which seriously threatens the underlying distribu
t.ion of power in S<>Ciety.
If 'class' is used in a broad sense here to refer to groups that share
structurally sin1ilar life options. then our earlier discussion of strategic.:
gender interests beco1nes relevant. It is not necessary to believe that all
wornen will prioriti1.e the same set of interests: they are by no means
endowed with a natural solidarity stem1ning from their biological
attributes. "fheir needs and priorities are the product of a number of
interse('ling relations, including their relationship to the means of
production. Nevertheless. in given contexts. women and men ma\'
have different and conAicting interests. arising out of the inequalities
of power and privilege embedded in concrete relations of gender.
Once these relations are brought into the analysis, they provide
con1pelling reasons why n1ale-dominated p<>licyn1aking bodies n1a~·
favour certain kinds of interventions over others. Men's strategic
gender interests help to shape, however unintentionally, the meaning
given to 'the social welfare function' within the policy domain, as well
as the design and i1nplen1entation of the pr<tiects which How from
these interpretations. Male interests are evident at a number of

shape project design, and subverting the implen1entation process. We
\\•ill consider brieAy how this works in practice.
S(;BA is in1plicitly premissed on the assun1ption that good proje<.:t
design can be used to correct for distortions in the broader environ

intended to ensure that project-level calculations are freed of distor

process by which the 'control areas' within which planners operate are
demarcated. This was a point implicit in a cost-benefit exercise carried
out by Greeley ( 1987) on mechanized rice milling in Bangladesh,
which had improved rural labour productivity, but had also led to the
erosion of one of the few employment opportunities available to poor,
landless women. Although by SCBA criteria, the welfare costs of
mechanized mills exceeded their benefits, Greeley concluded that
curtailing the spread of such mills could not be contemplated because,
among other reasons, it was unlikely that the regulations could be
effectively policed. In Greeley's word, 'Planners who find that the
value judgement of [SCBA analysis] is acceptable and that intervention
to stop huller mills is desirable in principle will also be aware that the
control areas they command and policy implementations cannot be
juggled into shape in the same way that a social cost-benefit analysis
can' ( 1987, p. 292). This is another way of saying that when the
interests of a powerful group, however small (wealthy farmers and
traders, mainly men), are evaluated against the interests of a disem
powered group, however large (poor, landless women), it is unlikely
that recommended interventions which favour the latter have much
chance of being implemented.
However, the problem is deeper than one of powerful sections of the
community demarcating planners' 'control areas'. Gender politics are
woven into the planning process itself. Male privilege is frequently
protected in the design of policies and projects through the use of
normative assumptions which permit women's independent interests
to vanish through their association with - and subsumption under -
socially acceptable 'others'. The classic assumption of this kind is that
men are the primary or sole breadwinners and economic decision
makers. Women are cast in the role of financial dependents, respons
ible only for family welfare. This permits the distribution of employ
ment and productive resources to male heads of households; women
enter as 'unpaid fan1ily labour' or are assigned to small-scale, unpro
ductive income-generating projects which do little to challenge the
power relations of the household. The case studies of agricultural
projects from The Gambia, Cameroon and Kenya cited earlier are
examples of this type of assumption.
A second common assumption by which women's interests are made
to vanish is by conflation with their children. As Buvinic notes,
'potential conflicts between women's and children's welfare are
customarily resolved in [welfare-oriented] programs by emphasising
women's motherhood roles, thereby making children's welfare the
ultimate objective' (Buvinic, 1983, p. 25 ). 'fhe same point is made in an

article entitled 'Where is the M [n1other] in MCH [Mother (:hild
Health]' where the authors point out that the bulk of funds in mother
child health programmes in the Third World are spent on children's
health on the general assumption that 'what is good for the child is
good for the mother' (Rosenfield and Maine, 1985). This certainly
appeared to have been Greiner's assumption; as we noted, his
advocacy of breast-feeding rested on the welfare of the infant and the
invisibility of the mother. In reality, important biological and social
synergies make the reverse relationship equally significant; women's
nutritional status affects the birth weight of infants (WHO, 1980), and
women's control over resources can have a beneficial effect on
children's nutritional and health status (Longhurst, 1988; Kennedy
and Cogill, 1987). Referring back to our discussion in Chapter 5 on the
long hours that women work in rural Gambia, there is striking
evidence to demonstrate the link between the well-being of mothers
and children. According to ·1·he Gambia's census, 30 per cent of
children in the rural areas die by the age of two; a detailed village study
indicates that more than half die before their fifth birthday. Sixty-eight
per cent of these deaths occur in the busy rainy season when women's
workload is at its peak. Lower birth weights - and hence higher
probability of infant deaths - are especially likely when the last
trimester of a pregnancy occurs in the rainy season. The World Bank
( 1980) attributes the 'extremely high infant and child mortality rates·
in 'fhe Gan1bia to the 'unsatisfactory situation of their mothers, who
usually are badly nourished and heavily overworked' (p. 19).
Finally, there are other, more active ways in which men protect and
promote their strategic gender interests within the policy process. The
earlier WID literature concentrated on the assumptions underlying
policy f<>rmulation. More recent research has uncovered the implica
tions (>f largely covert forms of male resistance for the implementa
tion, and hence for the actual outcomes, of policies ostensibly geared
to gender-aware efficiency or equity goals. As Staudt observes:
Bureaucratic officials increasingly confront policies which, if implemented.
pron1pl the redistribution of resources and values between men and
wornen, a threatening prospect that incurs political conflict in ways no
different from politically provocative class redistribution. However. such
conHict occurs behind the closed doors of bureaucracy. as threatened
officials personalise such prospects and resist, deflect and/or undermine
those policies. The bureaucratic resistance lo women's programmes that
comes from redistributive threats is a critical phenomenon. (Staudt, 1986,
p. 329)

SOCIAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
Consequently, even where gender redistribution features as an
intended objective in the project design, it is unlikely to feature in
project outcomes if those responsible for their implen1entation are
able to subvert these goals. Analysing why projects for poor women
which had started out with explicitly production-oriented goals
frequently assumed welfarist features in the process of implementa
tion, Buvinic ( 1986) concluded that welfare-oriented action was seen
as promoting 'appropriate' roles for women and (most importantly) as
not taking away resources from men. Underlying the fear that poor
women might compete with poor men for development resources
appeared to be the anxiety that there might be 'unwelcome' social
changes within the family. She quotes a high-level official in a planning
ministry who supported income-generating pr~jects for women as
long as they did not lead to women earning more than men, since he
perceived this as having undesirable consequences within the family.
Equity goals at policy level are even more likely to be subverted in
practice. I will summarize here Carney's findings ( 1988) from the latest
chapter of the epic saga of Gambian irrigation schemes, which
documents how men's gender interests have operated in the imple
mentation process to subvert the apparent commitment to gender
equity expressed in project goals. This scheme was begun in Jahally
Parchar in 1984 as a large-scale, centralized operation seeking to
introduce double cropping in rice through a system of contract
farming. The project donors and management sought to reverse the
effects of earlier schemes by awarding rights to the newly irrigated
plots to the original female rice farmers. While the scheme was
successful in increasing real incomes in the area, 87 per cent of the
plots were registered in male names. An assessment of the scheme by
von Braun et al. ( 1989, p. l 0) concluded that gender distributive goals
were difficult to enforce through 'bureaucratic means such as land
titles, which have little relevance in the field'. Carney's study ( 1988),
elaborating why 'bureaucratic means' had failed, draws attention to
the issue of male resistance in the implementation process. She notes
that international publicity around women's grievances after a first
round of land distribution had led to IFA D, the major donor this time
round, assuming direction of the second distribution. The second
distribution dramatically increased the number of plots registered in
women's names. However, subsequent research revealed that, despite
being registered in women's names, the irrigated plots were being
designated as compound holdings. Consequently, despite the project's
objectives, women had no individual rights to the land. Carney traces
this partly to the continuing struggle over land rights between women
and men, sparked off by forty years of government disruption of

rather than that of men. Aligning control over plots with the work unit
that most closely resembles the actual labour force in cultivation could
have resulted in a more e<1uitable outcome. Pr<~ject n1anagers could
also have defended won1en·s usufructuary rights, if not on the
pumped plots, then at least in the tidal irrigated areas where these
rights had a prior existence. Carney concludes by pointing to the
difficulties of implen1enting equity goals in rural development pro
jects: 'powerful ideological forces are at play in maintaining existing
rural, political and econon1ic alignments. 'fhe challenge for policy
makers and donors interested in implementing equity goals is to

Conclusion: Hones for Courses?
Bearing these points in mind, how useful is CBA in gender planning?
·rhe reality is that CBA, like any other evaluative n1ethodology, carries
within it an implicit set of goals which it is best equipped to deal with. If
a typology of evaluation n1ethods were constructed according to the
policy goals they were best suited to evaluate, CBA would perform best
with interventionist, rather than participatory, projects; with projects
that have single objectives, preferably related to efficiency, rather than
th<>se with multiple or equity-related objectives; and with costs and
benefits that can be assigned market values, or at least clear shadow
prices. Once qualitative objectives are introduced and the principle of
commensurability is abandoned, the clarity and power of CBA starts to
leak away. Clear specification of distributional weights will only partly
compensate for the move from the realm of the objective, or at least
the observable, into the realm of the subjective and more explicitly
political. (:ost-effective or Logical Framework analysis, which allow
more explicit recognition of non-monetary and non-quantifiable
considerations in the project planning cycle, are other options to
SCBA in these situations, but they retain a common bias towards
quantifiable indicators.
Focusing more specifically on projects dealing with gender equity
considerations, cost-benefit methodology is still likely to be useful for
those that confine themselves to women's daily practical needs and are
therefore unlikely to encounter male resistance. Here, SCBA can help
to spell out the resource implications of alternative ways of meeting
these needs for the benefit of decision-makers. The difficulties begin
when projects seeking to implement redistributive or empowering
strategies have to be appraised or evaluated by decision-makers who
do not share - and may be threatened by - these objectives. Here the
use of SCBA is an altogether more dubious practice. It is unlikely to
capture benefits and costs as envisaged by those proposing the project,
but it offers decision-makers a facade of neutrality in rejecting the
.
proJect.
For those policy-making agencies who wish to encourage and
promote women's empowerment, more participatory forms of plan
ning and evaluation, based on analysing the objectives, successes and
problems of a project as seen by the various stake-holders in the
process and in partnership with those the project is intended to serve,
might be a more appropriate approach (see contributions to Rahman,
1982; Fernandes and Tandon, 1981 ; Greeley et al., 1992; Dighe and
Jain, 1989). While participatory approaches to evaluation may appear
to be unduly subjective and politicized, their advantage is that they are

Implementing the Right to
Choose: Women, Motherhood and
Population Policy
The Independent on Sunday: Which world event are you
most worried about?
David Bellamy (naturalist): My main concern is that there
are one and a half billion women in the world of child
bearing age. If they all got pregnant at one time the world
population would go up by one and a half billion -
something very few people think about. ( 17 January 1993)
Women know that child bearing is a social, not purely
personal, phenomenon: nor do we deny that world popula
tion trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on
resources and institutions by the end of this century. But our
bodies have become a pawn in the struggles among states.
religions, male heads of households, and private corp
orations. (Sen and Grown, 1985, p. 42)
Introduction
Population policies in the past few decades offe r an excellent illus
tration of why merely targeting women, without considering the
broader social relations in which they live, is unlikely either to change
their lives or to achieve intended goals. As the pressure of population
on limited resources becomes identified in many minds as the major
cause of world poverty, women are being seen as both the cause and
therefore the potential solution. I have used the quotation from David
Bellamy lo open this chapter because it appears to crystallize both past
and present features of this state of mind. The present is evident in the
growing involvement of environmentalists in population debates,

leading to new versions of the old link between population growth and
global disaster. But the past continues in the singling out of women as
the cause of overpopulation. If Bellamy's fears are realized and all
billion and a half women in the reproductive ages get pregnant at the
same tin1e. some acknowledgen1ent needs to be made of the contribu
tion that n1en have n1ade to this outcome. Yet men are generdlh
invisible when it comes to considering issues of reproduction.
Feminists in this held have long been aware of the contradictof)
ways in which n1otherhood and mothers are treated within the policy
discourse. Motherhood as a ·role' f<Jr women is given a visibility and
significance that is not attached to fatherhood as a 'role' for men. It is
treatecl as the reason, rationale and realization of women's nurturing
instincts, and n1ost policy concerned with family welfare and family
planning tends to be targeted at won1en. At the same time, women as
mothers or would-be mothers are rarely perceived as competent
actors, capable of making responsible choices in their own and in their
fan1ilies' interests. Instead they are subjected to agendas which have
been detern1ined elsewhere by policy-makers who have little or no
ac<:ountability to them. ·rhis chapter discusses shifting perspectives in
population policy over the past decades as well as important continu
ities. It also outlines son1e different fen1inist responses to the official
population policies before going on to outline a feminist case for an
alternative policy.
Changing Perspectives on the Population Question
·rhe importance given to population control is evident in the res<>urces
currently allocated to population-related progran1mes. Each year,
about USS I billion is spent on fa1nily planning in the Third World.
About $100 million is spent by individuals then1selves on contracep
tion, $400 million is spent by Third World govern1nent.s, and $500
million by the Western population establishment (cited in Hartmann
1987). l'he United States alone spent $235 million in I 988 (Germain
and Ordway, 1989), and accounts for about 50 per cent of all
population assistance (UNFPA, 1989).
Concern with p<>pulation control has figured prominently on the
development agenda at least since the early 1960s, when India became
the first developing country officially to set up a Department of Family
Planning in its Ministry of Health. However, like all other aspects of
development, perspectives and paradigms in the population debate
have undergone several shifts over the years. 'fhe first decades of
development were dominated by fears that population growth in the

Third World would literally eat into the fruits of economic progress,
leading to deepening poverty on a global scale. Financed initially by
the US and other Western governments, and later adopted by a
number of Third World governments, the massive dissemination of
contraceptive technology was the hallmark of this period.
The 1974 World Population Conference at Bucharest took place at a
time when the entire growth-dominated paradigm was under great
strain. A number of Third World and socialist countries suggested that
the narrow focus of Western governments on the 'population prob
lem' was a way of distracting attention from the underlying inequalities
in the international economic order. They also pointed out that it was
the spread of economic and social progress in Europe at the beginning
of the twentieth century which had brought about sustained and
widespread declines in fertility. The lesson to be drawn from this was
that 'development was the best contraceptive'. The World Population
Plan of Action adopted at Bucharest reflected a new and broader
international awareness of population issues. It declared that popula
tion programmes were constituent elements of socio-economic deve
lopment policies rather than substitutes for them. It specifically
recognized the right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and
responsibly the number and spacing of their children, and to have
access to the information, education and means to do so. The
Bucharest Conference marked a decade when, alongside the continu
ing dissemination of contraceptive methods, greater attention began
to be paid to the underlying social context which led to high rates of
fertility.
The late 1970s also saw changes in policy approaches to the related
question of health service delivery. Most post-colonial governments in
the developing world had sought to model their health services on
those of the advanced industrialized countries. The result was highly
centralized health systems which were state-financed, hospital-based
and relied on a small number of highly trained physicians. This
approach came under increasing criticism for being too expensive,
reaching too few people, being biased toward the urban sector, and
placing too much emphasis on curative services.
In a major attempt to reorient health systems to the needs and
resources of developing countries, 134 countries endorsed the new
Prim~ry Health Care (PHC) approach at the Alma Ata conference in
1978. 'I wo central elements in PHC are its focus on the preventive

recession and structural adjustn1ent policies had precipitated cutbacks
in state expenditures on social services in many developing countries;
p<>pulation assistance to the developing world currently represents 1.3
per cent of total Official Develop1nent Assistance compared to around
2 per cent in the 1970s (UN FPA, 1989). Declines in social service
expenditures were particularly drastic in sub-Saharan Africa and
resulted in a severe deterioration of health-care provision: shortages
of vehicles, fuel and n1aintenance services, understaffing of clinics and
hospitals, and shortfalls in supply of critical drugs and medical
equipment (Con1monwealth Secretariat, 1989; Leslie et al., 1988). The
hun1an cost of this adjustment was, as we noted in the first chapter. a
slowing down and in son1e cases a reversal in the previous steady
progress in social indicators.
A consequence of this crisis in the health systems of the Third World
has been a growing preoccupation with achieving economies in the
delivery of health care. The increasing emphasis on cost recovery or
user fees is one clear response to constrained government and
international funds for the health sector. There has also been a
tendency to f<>eus on selective pri1nary-health-care provision which
deals only with a li,nited number of ·cost-effective', vertically delivered
elements of PHC (for example, family planning and the child survival
revolution based on the GOBI strategy: growth monitoring, oral
rehydration therapy, breast-feeding and in1munization) rather than
on the full range of measures considered necessary for preventive
health care. As we shall argue in the next section, cutbacks in family
planning and health-care provision have implications for the broader
context in which fertility behaviour is located.
Women and Population: A Long-Standing I .ink
Women have always received a disproportionate amount of attention
in population-control programn1es. This is in marked contrast to their
negligible presence in other spheres of development research and
policy; according to Ware (1981), for instance, prior to International

WOMEN, MOTHERHOOD AND POPULATION POLICY
Women's Year in 1975, less than I per cent of sixty development texts
specifically referred to women. The prominent place accorded to
1
I
women in the population literature reflects the very real significance of ;
motherhood in most women's lives. It overlooks, however, the fact that
women's lives encompass more than just child-bearing and child
rearing; that women all over the world balance a greater multiplicity of
roles and responsibilities than male members of their households. The
equation of womanhood with motherhood embedded in early population
policy is a construct of policy makers rather than a reflection of reality.
The focus on women in the development debate began to widen
beyond family-planning and welfare concerns in the 1970s. As we
noted in Chapter I, one reason for this was that social-science research
had begun to highlight the fertility-reducing impact of enhancing
women's status, as measured by indicators such as literacy, education,
employment and decision-making power. Furthermore, the desig
nation by the UN of two successive years as World Population Year and
International Women's Year (1974 and 1975) encouraged members of
the international development community to think about the two
issues simultaneously and to take an interest in the connection between
woman's roles and population growth (Newland, 1977). Recognition
of this important relationship had considerable ramifications for
population policy. Women's contributions in arenas other than that of
biological reproduction received greater attention and resulted in the
promotion of projects to enhance women's earning power. Unfortun
ately, while such activities may have increased women's access to cash
incomes, there is no evidence that it transformed their dependent
status within their families and communities, or even that it had the
expected effect on their fertility behaviour. As the World Bank points
out, 'employment seems to have an independent effect on fertility only
for women in well-paid, modern jobs' (1984, p. 110). In general, the
forms of employment generated by women's projects over the past
decade were neither 'modern' nor 'well-paid' and focused on income
generation rather than sustainable employment.
Moreover, changes in the international economy over the past
decade, and concomitant changes in the provision of social services,
have highlighted more sharply than ever the contradictions entailed in
creating mainstream employment opportunities for women. These
contradictions stem from the conflicting demands made on women's
time by their roles in the production and care of human resources
juxtaposed with their involvement in the production of material and
financial resources for their households. Both economic crisis and
adjustment policies have made women's contribution to household
income critical to the survival of poor and middle-income households.

chores which they have to complete before they can undertake an}·
other tasks. Initiatives to transform women's productive opportunities
- and hence their reproductive strategies - are unlikely to be
successful if they take no account c>f women's existing domestic labour
overheads. The conflicting labour den1ands that women experience in
their roles as health carers, producers and mothers have not been
helped in the past by the sectoral approach that characterizes
policymaking in both national and international agencies. Like the
other aspects of developn1ent, a gender-aware population policy must
be firrnly grounded within a holistic framework.

WOMEN, MOTHERHOOD AND POPULATION POLICY
Population Policy and the Politics of
Needs Interpretation
"fhe continuing controversy over population policy attests to the
contradictory meanings that it assumes for different actors in the
development field. A useful framework for discussing some of these
differing meanings is suggested by Fraser's discussion of what she calls
the 'politics of needs' ( 1989, p. 164). She points out that discourse
about needs has been an important element of public interventions,
particularly in relation lo social welfare. How needs are perceived,
prioritized and met has functioned as a medium for making claims and
distributing resources. The politics of needs can be seen to comprise
three moments, analytically distinct but closely interrelated. The first is
the struggle to secure the political status of a need, that is, to establish
that an identified need is a legitimate area for policy concern rather
than a matter for the 'private' domestic or market spheres. The second
is the struggle over the interpretation of this need and hence how to
satisfy it. ·rhe third is the struggle to secure or withhold the resources
needed for the satisfaction of this need.
Both the official population establishment and many women's
health advocates agree that there is a 'need', largely unmet and
particularly in the Third World, for. ~O!Jlra_c_::eptiv~. tec~-~~logy. But
there are substantial differences in the way in which this need is
interpreted. Most feminists have struggled to give women's need for
reproductive technology a political status as one element of their
broader rights to exercise control over their bodies and their lives.
This, however, has not been the status given to the need for
reproductive technology within the population establishment,
although reproductive choice is more frequently invoked now as a
secondary rationale for their programmes. Rather, the official
interpretation has been lo conflate women's needs for reproductive
choice with the policy needs generated by long-standing c<>ncerns with
population control. Consequently, official population policy has fre
quently operated as a denial of women's choice, rather than as an
enhancement. In addition, the vagaries of First World politics juxta
posed with the asymmetrical nature of political accountability in donor
funding have led to politically driven shifts and reversals in official
definitions of reproductive choice for Third World women. This is
well illustrated in an examination of US population policy, summar
ized here from Jaquette and Staudt ( 1988).
In the sixties, the publications of an influential book by Paul Ehrlich ,'
( 1968) predicting global apocalypse as a result of unrestricted popula
tion growth, combined with fears of political instability in the Third

\\'orld as a result of such growth, had led to USAID support for tht'
theory that ·overp<>pulation· was the primary cause of Third World
p<>verty. From the title of Ehrlich's txx,k (Th, Population Bomb) to the
cl<>se association posited between the population explosion in the
·rhircl World and US security interests, to the militaristic terminolog\'
used to describe it. this support was manifested as a 'war· on
population. Ravenholt. then director of USAID, adopted what he
called a p<>licy of 'contraceptive inundati<>n' to deal with 'the people
epide1nic', with women singled out as its biological 'first cause·.
US p<>licy was strongly criticized f«>r its preoccupation with the
population problen1 by ·rhird World countries at the 1974 Population
conference. It also can1e in for strong attack within the US by the
W<>n1en's n1ovement as a result of the publicity given to its practice of
dumping unsafe contraceptives on the ·rhird World. AID subse
quently n1odified its single-minded focus on the dissemination of
contraceptives and began devoting n1ore resources to investigating
and adc.lressing the social conditions that gave rise to the demand for
children. However. by the time the Second International Conference
was held in Mexico in 1984, positions had reversed. Third World
countries were now generally comn1itted to the idea that their
resources could not support unrestricted population growth, while the
US position had swung around radically in deference to developments
in its domestic politics. ·rhe neo-liberal stance of the Reagan regime
led to the attribution of poor econon1ic performance in ·rhird World
countries to excessive state intervention rather than to over
population; private enterprise and market-led growth were now seen
as the best contraceptive. 'fhe Reagan government adopted a 'neutral
stance· on population growth but withdrew all support from any
development agency that was associated with provision of abortion.
'With this one stroke the Reagan administration was able to pay a debt
to the moral m~jority ... underline its rejection of Third World
demands for a New International 1:-:conomic Order ... and reinforce
its message that capitalism is the only model that works' (Jaquette and
Staudt, 1988, p. 226).
Jaquette and Staudt p<>int to the lack of accountability built into
foreign-assistance Hows so that the definition of population as an issue
and its translation into US development assistance occurs outside the
'political feedback loop' which might have helped to soften policy
excesses: 'one of the virtues of a pluralist political process - that those
affected by policies are actively involved in setting those policies and
monitoring their implementation - was absent' (p. 215). In fact, the
absence of won1en's interests in the shaping of population policy has
been one of its enduring charal'.teristics across the world. In some

contexts, women enter the policy process only as the targeted clients of
family-planning services which frequently violate the principles of
human rights and reproductive choice. In others, they are denied the
ability to curtail their fertility on the grounds of religious doctrine or
because the national interest is deemed to be served by high-growth
demographic regimes.
Examples of coercive practices - and a concomitant indifference to
human rights- abound in the literature on family planning. Occasion
ally official attempts to enforce particular forms of fertility behaviour
have taken the form of overt violation of human rights. This, for
instance, occurred during the Emergency in India in 1975/76 when
central government pressure on family-planning workers to meet
sterilization quotas led to the setting up of vasectom cam sand police
raids to round up 'eligible' men for forc1 le sterilization (Gwatkin,
1979; Banerji, 1980). More often, however, coercive measures are
brought to bear on targeted populations in other, more hidden ways:
through the highly selective promotion of contraceptive technology,
through the use of incentives and disincentives, or through the
selective dissemination of particular methods. Thus a team of demo
graphers working in South India noted that local family-planning
clinics gave wealthy villagers a choice of contraception, but offered the
poor no alternative to sterilization (Caldwell et al., 1982). An editorial
in a prestigious Indian weekly commented in 1985: 'The family
planning program is beginning to resemble a giant, over-developed
and hyperactive limb growing out of an inefficient health system which
is incapable of supervising and controlling it' (Economic and Political
Weekly, vol. 20, no. 4, p. 1668).
The Puerto Rican example is discussed in Mass's critique of US
population assistance. Economically integrated into the US since the
--
start of the century, Puerto Rico passed a law legitimizing sterilization
-
in 193 7. By 1968 around a third of Puerto Rican women of child-
bearing age had been sterilized on the island, supported initially by
US
private American f u~~ and subsequently by' the government
unaei-Johnson. The opinion-otaii·e,nii1enlaen:1ograplier-;-J.1.f.-Sfycos,
was that many physicians on the island supported sterilization because
'they thought and still think that contraceptive methods are too
difficult for lower-class Puerto Rican women' (quoted in Mass, 1976, p.
95). The f~ntempt ~r women's ability to make choices implicit in the

compulsory sterilization of one spouse after the second child, and
compulsory IUD insertions. It is also believed to have created an
increase in female infanticide (Peop~·s Daily reports, cited in Hillier.

Dutch, British. Scandinavians and UNICEF expressed their unhappi

MCH services, and demanded assurances that the World Bank
Population Ill programme would be reformed and monitored (Han

control in many foreign-funded progran1mes laid them open to
suspicionsof'genocidal intent' (Sai, 1973; Warwick, 1982; Bondestam.
1980).
'rhe effects of pro-natalist policies that pressurize women lo have
more children than they want have been as repugnant as those which
enforce lower fertility. Religion remains a powerful force in denying
women the right to contraception and abortion in both First and Third
Worlds. ·rhe (:atholic Church, for instance, maintains an implacable
hostility to both. Yet its prohibition on abortion is little more than a
hundred years old. Prior to that, a controversy had raged about
'ensouln1ent': al what point does the foetus become human and receive
a soul so that abortion becomes homicide? It had been the Church's
position that ensoulment did not take place prior to 'quickening' or
foetal movement5, which in a first pregnancy occurs around fifteen to
seventeen weeks, so that by implication, abortion prior to this period
did not constitute a mortal sin. Currently. however, the Church
position is that a fertilized ovum constitutes a genuine human person
from the moment of conception and therefore possesses an inalienable
right to life. However, the Church's own confusion on this matter is
suggested by the fact that newly fertilized ova are not regarded as
human persons, except in the context of abortion, so that fertilized ova
which fail to implant (around 50 per cent) and are discharged
normally by the body are not baptised. 'Most significantly, a foetus
which miscarries even at a late stage of pregnancy is neither baptised as
a matter of ecclesiastical decree nor given a church burial.' As Greer
(1984) points out, such rituals would be in keeping with the Church's
position that it takes life before birth very seriously: 'The fact that they
do not carry out rituals of this kind suggest5 that in fact they do not
really believe what they maintain in polemic' (p. 161 ).

Despite the aln1ost total lack of abortion in the Republic of Ireland,
and its severe restriction in Northern Ireland, Irish women in the
twenty-two to twenty-five age group are as likely to have an abortion as
their English counterparts, and more Irish women per head of the
population have abortions than in Holland or Denmark. Criminalizing
abortion has never prevented it; it simply increases its human and
material costs to women. (The highly publicized case in 1992 of a
fourteen-year-old Irish schoolgirl, pregnant as a result of rape, taken
by her parents to England for an abortion and then forced to return by
an Irish High Court injunction, drew attention to what some of these
might be.)
C<>SlS
Drac<)nian measures to deny won1en the right to control their
I
fertility were taken in Romania where, in an effort to curb the decline
and ageing of the population, the (:eau~escu regime declared abortion
and family planning illegal. Women had to submit to checks every
three months to ensure that they were not using birth control. The
crude birth rate rose from 14.3 to 27.4 between 1966 and 1967 and
total fertility rate increased from 1.9 to 3.7 children. However, as a
World Bank report points out, there were high human costs to this
'apparent policy "success"· (World Bank, 1991, p. 128). An illegal
abortion industry sprang up as women turned to any means, including
self-induced abortions, to control their fertility, and birth rates began a
steady decline by 1967. Women also avoided gynaecological examina
tions and Romania now has the highest rate of cervical cancer
mortality in Europe. Maternal mortality rates jumped from under
70 per l 00,000 live births in 1965 to over 150 in 1967, with 85 per cent
attributable to abortion. lnfa nt mortality rates increased from 46.6 to
59.5 per thousand between 1967 and 1968 largely due to abandon
ment or neglect of unwanted infants (World Bank, 1991). The other
tragic casualties of the policy were the thousands of children placed in
institutional care. Most of them came from the economically most
vulnerable subgroups: gypsies; young, unmarried or single mothers;
the physically and mentally ill. In other words, it appeared that
poverty conditions in combination with large fa mity sizes were the key
factors associated with the institutionalization of children. A study
conducted by UNICEF and the Romanian government comments on
the human tragedy of the unwanted child: 'compromised parent
child attachment can lead to abandonment, child abuse and neglect,
failure to thrive, depression and mental illness in later life, maternal
feelings of incompetence, postpartum depression and development
delay' (1991, p. 24).

Feminist Debates and the Politics of
Needs Interpretation
For ferninists, the issue of reproductive rights crystallizes in many ways
the whole question of women's rights over their own bodies. It is in the
area of reproduction that women's bodies and social experiences
differ most significantly from those of men. Women's rights to bear or
not bear children is considered central to their sense of selfhood: 'our
bodies are our selves'. Consequently, contraceptive technolog}·
appeared to hold out to won1en the promise of greater control over
their own l><><lies. However, among feminists also, the politics of
reproductive needs have led to conflicting positions on the question of
reproductive technology. For son1e, women's ability to adopt family
planning was seen as indicative of their greater autonomy over their
lives. Writing from Bangladesh, Sattar ( 1979) suggested that 'any
support to the family planning programme is a support to women and
children ... Acceptance of a family planning method means that a
woman can control her own fertility. This leads very often to a gain in
self-confidence and is the first step to a woman looking outside the
home for work' (pp. l:l-14).
By and large, however. feminists have perceived official population
programmes as an infringement on women's autonomy rather than an
enhancement of it. Their opposition to them has generally been
aligned with different political perspectives on the women's question
in development. Written in the 1970s, Mass's critique cited earlier
offers a dependency feminist analysis of population programmes. Her
study asked why women's right to birth control, a potentially progress
ive demand, had long been supported by oppressive states, and whose
interests were thus served. She concluded that birth control offered
under the aegis of population control served a variety of imperialist
interests. She noted that these interests had their own 'dependency
theory', viz. the consumption drain on economic growth represented
by the large proportion of young dependents in Latin American
populations. However, she suggested that this focus on overpopula
tion as the cause of underdevelopment was an 'elaborate veiling of the
system's unequal distribution of wealth and its exploitation of labour
power' (p. 3) and its inability to generate sufficient growth in the Third
World to be able to feed and provide work for its population. She

of a more immediate strategy, however, she suggested that women

skills in dealing with nature in a con1passiona1e, humane and ecologi
cally sustainable way, on the other: 'We want to renew, reaffirm and
build up<Hl this fen1ale tradition.'
Akh1er (1988) another FINRRAGE member, suppons its india
n1ent of the 'anti-natural' effects of modern reproduaive techno
logies: 'Fron, a natural point of view. the human species are endowed
I
with the power to procreate. 11 is a vital power that ensures the species·
survival. But <·on1racep1ive le<·hnologies in this case act against this
power. ·rhey mutilate the human body, interfere with the biological
processes, and build harriers with the reprcxluctive organs, disrupting
' I
lxxlily functions' (p. 153). She also draws attention to the repressi\'e
ways in which international population controllers, supported b)·
coercive state machineries and the 'techncxlocs', have identified
women in a <ieliberate policy to 'depopulate' Bangladesh: 'uteri of
Bangladeshi won1en have be<:<lme the direct hit of the population
controllers through the mediation of the state' (p. 156).
While the potential of traditional medicine has certainly been
neglected by the population establishment, and shrugged off by the
pharmaceutical industry, and while reproductive technologies have
been distributed in ways that frequently violate human rights. the
'either/or' p<llitic·s of FIN RRA(;E paradoxically also leads to a denial of
chc>ice 10 wc>n1en. ·rhe blanket conden1nation of all forms of reproduc
tive technology frequently leads FINRRA(;E members to deny the
legitimacy of the expressed needs and practices of women in many
parts of the world, and to shrug off the p<>ssibility that women ma}'
choose contraceptive methods, with full knowledge of the risks. The
1nilitaristic terminology adopted by FINRRAGE n1embers echoes. in
many ways, the language of the population-c<>ntrol establishment,
suggesting that they are also engaged in a war over who should control
women's bodies and reproductive capacity. And. as in many wars. it
appears that there can be only two sides. Akhter suggests that \\'omen
are motivated to accept contraceptive methods. specifically those
promoted by the p<>pulation c<>ntrollers, by the creation of an
environn1ent in which they are made to think that they are 'stupid' if
they do not accept' (Akhter, 1988, p. 158). Yet the views that she
advances are the mirror image of those she attributes to the population
establishn1ent. If the population controllers created a situation where
women felt 'stupid' if they did not accept reproductive technologies,
FINRRAGE members appear to regard women as dupes of patriarchy
if they do.
·rhe argument that women n1ight want to use reproductive techno
logies in order to have - or not have - children is given shc>rt shrift by
most FINRRA(;E members. The 1989 conference devoted some time
Google Original from

WOMEN, MOTHERHOOD AND POPULATION POLICY
to discussing the hopes and despair of women seeking IVF (in vitro
fertilization) treatment, but as Ute Winkler (FINRRAGE) declared,
such women were 'simply objects of such techniques'. 2 She argued that
it was necessary simultaneously to expose the use of IVF and to offer
counselling to infertile women to reject IVF:
We cannot wait until we have convinced all women who are infertile that
they should r~ject IVF before we . .. formulate our position in public. Just
knowing that women are opposed to IVF may give these women the
support they need to stop or reject IVF treatment. .. . And don't forget:
I VF is not a solution for infertility. Women are still infertile when they
conceive through IVF.
Equally the argument that women might wish to use reproductive
technology to control their fertility is disn1issed as merely reflecting
coercive male sexuality rather than women's self-identified need. As
the 1989 conference report notes:
Kan1axi of India reported that poor women in the villages do want to get
contraception because they do not want to bear so many children. It is not
only a demand of the educated women. In reply to that, Farida (Akhter)
said, it is because the poor women in the villages do not have the power to
say no to the sexual desire of men. We probably need to change our ways of
looking at problems.
'fhe question of men's sexual access was brought up elsewhere in the
conference report when another Indian participant argued that 'We
can change the man- woman relationship in 100 years, but right now
we have 20 million people who want contraceptives.' This was
challenged by Klein (FINRRAGE), who argued that women's
demands for contraception had to be seen in the context of men's
belief in their rights to sexual access to women.
The report concluded that, 'There was some disagreement
expressed regarding the individuality involved in the act of sexual
relationships and many came away with different understandings of
what was being said.' One such 'different understanding' of sexuality
from that apparently subscribed to by FINRRAGE members would
suggest that sexual pleasure is not simply the monopoly of men, that it
is not always imposed by men on women, and that the desire to use
contraception may also represent a desire by women to enjoy sex
without anxieties about unplanned pregnancy. One version of this
alternative view is offered in a monograph compiled by three feminists
active in the arena of reproductive rights in India: (Chayanika, Swatija
and Kamaxi, 1990):

lo
FINRRAGE puts forward many legitimate criticisms of the current
state of reproductive technology and policy, but its arguments betray a
disregard for the needs of different women and a lack of respect for
women who do not share their views. Its blanket conflation of
tethnology with patriarchy, of use with abuse, undermine what would
otherwise have been a powerful critique of the population establish
ment. In the next section, I would like to a!'_gue that policies which
pr~_2te _reprod.ucti.v~ _technology as an element of reproductive
cfioi<;e <:an be. coinpatible witJ-i,. and 1ncf~e~.--g~.cf.~[1~~--a broader
feminist goal of equili!ble .<:f~ve!~pn!e.nL. We need to consider popula
tion · policies in terms of two crucial and related dimensions: the
problems associated with the technology itself and those stemming
from the interests that are promoted through, and the power relations
that g<>vern, the formulation, design and implementation of current
population policies. Although the population establishment has had
considerable power in defining reproductive possibilities for women, it
has not been able to do it unchallenged. The issue of reproductive
rights has been fought for by a variety of actors and institutions over
the past decades and is finally being recognized as a legitimate concern
within the development field. It is now essential to carry the politics of
needs identification into what Fraser identifies as a second arena of
struggle: the politics of needs satisfaction.
The Cue for a Feminist Population Policy
A feminist perspective on population policy would have to recognize
both the profound social implications of child-bearing as well as its
implications for individual women. Women experience motherhood
in contradictory ways. It can be experienced as a socially imposed
institution, which in some contexts is the only source of social
recognition available to them. It is also experienced as a deeply
personal relationship between themselves, their bodies and their
children (Rich, 1976). At the same time, as Sen and Grown (1985)
point out, 'Women know that child bearing is a social, not purely
Google Original from
Digitized by
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIAWOMEN, MOTHERHOOD AND POPULATION POLICY 203
personal, phenomenon; nor do we deny that world population trends
are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions
by the end of this century' (p. 42).
It is this interweaving between individual and social dimensions that
invests the decision to bear or not to bear children with such complex
and far-reaching ramifications. It has become clear that many of the
old connections made between public good and private choice in the
formulation of official population policy were far too simplistic. As the
World Bank acknowledges, 'birth control is not just a technical and
demographic issue; it has a moral and a cultural dimension. Becoming
a parent is both a deeply personal event and - in virtually all societies -
central to community life as well' ( 1984, p. 160). The 1984 World Bank
Report has sought to distance itself from any hint of 'neo-Malthusian
descriptions of population as a problem' (p. 184) in its analysis of the
link between development and population change. For the next five or
six decades, according to the Report, the problem of poverty 'goes
beyond one of global resources and is less easily amenable to any
technological fix' (p. 184). The report recognizes that, while the social
costs of large families may be high in terms of long-term investments in
the standard of living and economic growth, poor parents are making
a reasonable choice in having many children. l"he conditions of
poverty frequently engender high fertility.
The new danger is that current concerns about possible links
between population growth and environmental problems may give
fresh life to fertility-reduction arguments for population policy. Here,
too, it is clear that there is need for caution (Repetto, 1985; Rodgers,
1984; Commoner, 1988); the study of these interrelationships must
also include their mediation by different modes of resource exploita-
Ci. .
tion and consumption patterns. The needs of the world's poor, on the ,i ./
one hand, and the gree~ of the world'~ rich, on the ~ther, are the t~o
forces driving the p<>pulation-consumption-environment connection .. , · -: -·
One arises out of the search of poor populations seeking to squeeze a ·
livelihood from fragile environments, thereby causing soil depletion,
deforestation and other forms of localized destruction of the habitat.
'fhe other, which speeds up global warming through 'gas-guzzling'
cars and large-scale deforestation for industrial or export-oriented
cattle rearing, can be attributed to the consumption patterns of the
affluent. It may well be that high fertility rates are a part of the
response of poor people to their poverty and therefore implicated in
environmental degradation. But it should also be borne in mind, given
that a disproportionate amount of the world's resources are consumed
by a small minority located mainly in the North, that the greed of a
wealthy minority, rather than the need of the world's poor, deserves a

disprop<>rtionate share of the blame (see Action Aid Development
Report No. 5, 1991 f<>r S<>me illustrative figures).
A population p<>licy that is concerned with the needs of the poor, as
well as with the preservation of the natural environment, has to break
finally with the narrow fertility-reduction goals of the past and address
the social conditions in which reproductive choices can be enhanced.
When the focus is shifted from the social dimensions of reproductive
behaviour to the perS<>nal dimensions. the same conclusions emerge.
'fhat women (and sometimes men) all over the world want access to
repr<><luctive technology is testified to b<>th within statistical surveys as
well in the testimony of development and feminist activists (Dixon
M ueller and Gerrnain. 1992; Chavanika et al.. 1990; Sen and Grown.
,
1985; Torres, 1990; Petchesky and Weiner, 1990; Huq, 1992). There
are sound reasons for addressing this need. We have noted already the
unequal gender division of labour, rights and responsibilities in the
area of reproductive behaviour. While it may be in the interests of
domestic collectivities to have large numbers of children, the costs and
benefits of such a strategy are not equally distributed within the family.
Put simply, patriarchally organized families ensure that senior male
members reap the benefits of large families while women in the
reproductive ages bear the costs in the form of high rates of maternal
rnorbidity and mortality. Surely any notion of social justice, and
certainly any notion of gender equity. demands that those who bear
the main burden of reproductive responsibilities should also enjoy a
measure of reproductive choice.
However, as long as it is in the interests of domestic collectivities to
enforce particular patterns of fertility behaviour, women are unlikely
to exercise very much control over their reproduction. The slow
progress made by family-planning programmes, despite the resources
invested in them, in bringing about a change in fertility behaviour
highlights the limitations of purely individual solutions. A more
promising route forward is suggested by research which shows that

strong (Costa Rica, Korea and Singapore), and roughly equal in

rates where (a) development was strong but f amity planning relatively
weak (Brazil and ·rurkey); and (b) where development levels were low
but family-planning provision was strong (India and Indonesia).

Sen ( 1989) also confirms a correlation between national fertility
rates and a combination of infant mortality rates and selected
indicators of women's status (female secondary education, their age at
marriage); the correlation is further strengthened by the existence of a
strong family-planning effort. What is striking about these findings is

two different groups of women in the Third World, 'one with
reproductive responsibilities who are the target of health and nutrition
projects, and another group with productive responsibilities who are
the target of agricultural and income generation projects' (Leslie,
1989, p. 6). Among agencies concerned with hun1an resource develop
ment, there are further subdivisions; among multilateral agencies, for
instance, between those concerned with general health care (WHO),
those concerned with women's reproductive capacity (UNFPA), and
those concerned with children's health (UNICEF). The consequence
of this division of responsibilities is that different sectors have

on wo1nen's energy. time and health. Furthermore, agencies con
cerned with human resources have tencled to focus on women as the
family's health agents and reproducers to the detriment of their health
needs and well-being as producers. If the focus is broadened to take
account of women's role in pr<l<luction as well as reproduction, it

generations of a country's labour for<:e depend critically on women·s

( :learly the provision of contraceptive technology should remain on
the policy agenda since it is an in1p<>rtant element of reprodu<."tive well
being. But the manner of provision has to be radically rethought in the
light of past abuses. Furthermore, contraceptive provision should be
seen as only one element in a broader package of measures whose goal
is to enhance women's well-being and rights over their own bodies.
·rhe <>ther elements in this broader package have to be determined
through country-sJ>ecific analyses of population-health-development
linkages. The rest of this chapter offers a number of principles and
guidelines for a population poli<:y that seeks the goal of gender equity
and reproductive choice rather than fertility reduction per se. Starting
with the question of 'gender-awareness' within family-planning pro

art·ount of gender relations within societies at large.
A User Perspective on Family-Planning
Programmes
l'he controversy, resistance and setbacks encountered by family
planning programn1es in the l'hird World since their inception in the
1960s have largely been generated in opposition to the interests they
are perceived to serve. 'Family planning has been perceived by large
numbers of people . . . as being more politically oriented than health
attuned ... Many approaches have favoured top-down efforts with
their predominant f<x:us at national and government levels of admin
istration' (Syme. 1987). The two charges most frequently levelled
against the population establish,nent have been insensitivity to
women's reproductive rights and indifference to women's reproduct
ive needs. l 'hese must be the starting premiss for all interventions in
this field. l'he 'user perspective' developed by the Population Council
appears to be an attempt to operationalize this viewpoint. It emphas

that sustained use of contraception requires services that take account
- and art seen to be taking account - of individual needs and well-being.
This can be achieved in a number different ways.
First of all, reproductive choice must be op~r~ii>~_al~~d through
offering a clioiie . of"inf'7noaS. "t"h·e-sele~live promotion of forms Of
contraception that ren1ove ·reproductive control from women (sterili
zation, injectibles, implants and so on) does little to reassure the
population that the interests of users have shaped the provision of
services. Reproductive choice means recognizing that women do not
have uniform needs and are best served through access to the widest
range ol _! =_Qntrac«:e!;v·e _"!~thods-~µm pat_iJilfwith theirl-ieallh. This
would allow different subgroups of women in the reproductive ages to
tailor their contraceptive practice to their individual health needs and
social circumstances. It would allow them to plan the number and
spacing of children, delaying the first birth, terminating reproduction
and replacing child loss. It would allow the possibility of switching
methods as an alternative to discontinuation when a particular form of
contraception proved unsatisfactory. It would recognize that women
at different stages of their life cycle have different health
•
requirements.
Safe menstrual regulation and abortion are essential within the
choice of methods because of the possibility of contraceptive failure or
non-use, as well as to mitigate the more traumatic conditions caused by
rape, incest or risks to the mother's life. Wider provision of contracept
ives can diminish the incidence, but cannot prevent all unwanted
pregnancies. Abortion remains a major means offe rtility control in the
world. About 33 million safe, legal abortions are carried out each year.
Clandestine procedures raise the total to between 45 to 60 million
(Black. 1987). Globally this n1eans that there are between twenty-four
and thirty-two induced abortions for every one hundred known
pregnancies. It was pointed out at a recent international symposium
on women's health that throughout history women have resorted to
abortion, whether legal or not, for the sake of themselves and for their
children (Mair, 1989) and that restrictive laws do not stop abortions -
they simply make them unsafe (Germain, 1989). Indeed, an estimated
200,000 or more Third World women die needlessly each year due to
botched abortions; additional uncounted thousands suffer severe
morbidity problems. including infertility and chronic ill-health. Un
wanted pregnancies threaten women's health, well-being and human
rights; they also result in the tragedy of unwanted or abandoned
children and infanticide. The slogan of the women's movement in the
UK in the 1970s in response to legislative attempts to curtail the

health and fan1ily well-being. ()ver the past two decades, at least sixty
five jurisdictions have liberalized their ah<>rtion laws; only four
countries have restricted the grounds for procedure (CtlOk, 1989).
However, 28 per cent of the world's p<>pulation still lives in countries
where ah<>rtion is either illegal or can only be perforn1ed to save a
won1en's life. ·rhe differential rate of abortion-law reform between
industrialized and developing countries is an important factor in
explaining differential rates of maternal n1ortality and morbidity
between these two regions ((;<>ok, l Y89). Legalization alone does not
guarantee availability of abortion services (Sai and Nassim, 1989). In
India. for instance, where abortion is legal. only one in six abonions
are provided by trained personnel in safe conditions. In Bangladesh,
rnenstrual regulation services recognized and supported as a prevent
ive health service reach only I 0--20 per cent of the 75,000 ~-omen who

together with the provision of widespread low-cost services are

high rates of dissemination in large numbers of Third World
countries. However, its use is res1ric1ed to specific categories of women
in Sweden, Wesl Germany and the UK, and banned in the United
States where studies of its effects on humans are deemed insufficient
to confirm or refute the risk of cancer. More recently, Norplant

prevent pregnancy for al least five years) has also been promoted in
the Third World before having been approved in the United States
and some other European countries.
Advocates of population control oflenjustify this apparent indiffer
ence to the health risks of contraceptive lechnology by weighing them
against mortality risks from pregnancy. As lhe journal Population
Reports claims, 'With all methods, family planning in developing
countries is much safer than childbearing.' However, some of lhe flaws
of 1his position have been summarized by Hartmann and Standing
( 1989) who note thal such an argurnent penalizes the poor for their
poverty. High n1aternal n1or1ali1y rates are not only the consequence
of high fertility, bul also the product of inadequale nutrition, poor

annually on these programmes and the evidence of unmet need in the
p<>pulation, there are clearly 'important gaps in perception' (Zeiden
stein, 1980, p. 26) that need to be bridged between those who design
and develop programmes and those who use them. As Winikoff and
Sullivan ( 1987, p. 135) point out, the short continuation rates and lo"·
rates of effectiveness associated with so many fa mity-planning pro
gramn1es suggest that 'the reality of contraceptive practice is one of a
high incidence of failure'. Sporadic use and early discontinuation of
contraception does not serve either the narrower objective of fertilit}"
reducti<>n or the broader one of reproductive choice. Safety consid
erations require that the provision of contraceptive services should be
judged both in terms of their effectiveness as well as their health
implications for women. If there is a trade-off, then it is one that
women must make an informed choice about for themselves. Further
more, all provision should always include con1prehensive screening of
potential clients to ascertain their suitability for particular methods, as
well as subsequent follow-up pr<>eedures to minimize the possibility of
adverse side effects.
Finally, the users' perspective in family planning requires channels
for infonnatio11 sharing betw e_~n _l !s~_r-~ a!ld _p _ro~i~ers._ _1 -~ea~sence of
such channels often accounts for the ':1n_d~rs_ta.l"!~~l~.!ear~!-~ecula
tion,"-run10Lirs and niutuaT suspici<>r-i that hav~. c~ara~terjied.r.elations
between oflicial providers and users within the comn1unity. The
formation of user groups, perhaps building on existing cooperatives
and women's groups, the use of participatory forms of appraisal and
research, and the adoption of institutional mechanisms for communi
cation, feed-back and interaction between users, planners and pro
viders will help ensure greater responsiveness to users' needs and
continuous monitoring of programme effectiveness. Such mechan
isms can be used by f amity-planning workers to provide information
ab<>ut various aspects of their work: the safety and suitability of various
forms of contraception; the need to return for follow-up services; the
availability of counselling for abortion patients, and so on. They can
also be utilized by users to provide evaluative information about the
services received.
Indicators of success for family-planning programmes need t~ go
beyond simple target fulfilment or contraceptive ·acceptance rates.
Bruce ( 1980), for instance, suggests a variety of ways of evaluating
such programmes which go beyond measuring 'intentions' (for ex
ample, policy statements, budgets) to results (births spaced or averted).
One measure of long-term effectiveness in family-planning pro

1968, cited in Bruce, 1980), which measures rates of pregnancy by first
method used, ignoring whether pregnancy was accidental or not, and
counting only unwanted pregnancies. Here the emphasis is not on the
success or failure of individual women in using contraception, but on
whether programmes have instructed their clients sufficiently and
offered them effective alternatives if they needed to switch for any
particular reason.
Greater institutional responsiveness also requires that many more

_level. At present, women a-ppear mainly. as fiefd-ievel workers or as

out, 'a program cannot possibly comprehend women's views about
\
availability, choice, self-selection, program responsiveness, learning
opportunities or integration into woman's life experiences without
women in vital decision-making roles at every level' (p. 28). The
challenge, he points out, is to institute some form of affirmative action
that will enable the recruitment, training and support for women in
decision-making roles, rather than to wait until women with suitable
qualifications present themselves.

ago, the few contraceptive methods available were mostly male
methods and it is likely that the 'demographic transition' from high to
low fertility regimes in Europe and North America was achieved
mainly through the widespread use of withdrawal. Surveys carried out
in the US and the UK at the start of the 1960s suggested that 67 per
cent and 95 per cent of married women respectively had relied at some
stage on male methods (Popul.ation Reports, 1986). The introduction of
oral contraceptives and the IUD shifted patterns of contraceptive use
to women although there is some evidence of an increase in vasectom
ies in some Northern countries.

organized clinics and centres should be made widely available as an
effective way of terminating the reproductive cycle. Greater emphasis
should also be placed on research into new fo rn1s of male contracep
tion; one estimate suggests that only 8 per cent of the world's
contraceptive budget is spent on developing male methods of contra
ception. However, in addition to these features, fa mity-planning
programmes for men may also need to incorp<lrate a greater stress on
encouraging men to share responsibility for family planning. It has
been widely recognized that a major problem encountered in the
dissemination of contraceptives is not women's lack of motivation, but
the resistance of men. Since most family-planning programmes
behaved as though women make decisions about family planning in a
social vacuum, it is necessary to learn from the few examples available
of attempts to reach men in the workplace, in the community and in
health-care centres. The principle of responsible fatherhood has been
promoted through a variety of means in a number of Third World
countries (see P<>f>ulation Reports, Series J, No. 33, I 986). In Jamaica,
the National Family Planning Board organized lectures, panel discus
sion, motivational seminars, community and workplace-based discus
sions, booklets, posters and campaigns in the mass media. In
Mauritania, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs organized a
school for fathers to encourage men to be sensitive to women's health
problems and family planning. Educational outreach programmes for
y<>ung people have been organized in Hong Kong, Ireland and Sierra
Leone, sometimes using telephone hotlines to offer information and
advice in safe anonymity. The Caribbean Family Planning Affiliation
developed radio spots, posters and videos as a part of male-responsibil
ity campaigns in seven Caribbean islands, while both Nigeria and
Zimbabwe have also used the n1edia to address this issue. In India, the

over a decade. It has assisted employers and trade unions in various
developing countries to set up family welfare services at the workplace
and introduced population education into the curricula of vocational
training courses. It is essential that men's responsibility for family
welfare is not seen by policy makers solely in breadwinning terms.

Where is the M in MCH? The Neglect of
Women's Reproductive Health
Al<>ng with family planning. the other element in PHC that impinges
directly and specifically on women's health status is MCH (Mother and
(:hild Health) services. While the interlinkages between the health
status of mother and child are recognized by health policymaker...
their translation into prin1ary health care strategies has tended to be
rather selective. Resources have been most strongly concentrated on
family-planning provision and. within MCH, on children's welfare.
According to World Bank estimates, _most developing countries
all<>eate less than 20 per cent of their health budgets to maternal and
g<.>es-
child health progra1nn1es and the bulk of these_f!:!j1ds to child
liealth (1-ferz and Meashan1, 1987). · 'Even information on mothers·
health is sparse. According to the WHO, while fifty out of fifty-t~·o
countries have reported on infant mortality rates, only five have ever
reported on maternal mortality data. ·rhere is a general assumption
that 'what is good for the child is good f<>r the mother' (Rosenfield and
Maine, 1985 ). The reverse relationship - the ramifications of the
mother's health status on the child's - has received far less attention.
Moreover, the causes of maternal mortality differ from those of child
death rates and require different remedies. The net result of this
neglect of the 'M in MCH' _has bee_n _t!1_at_pr~!')J!ll")'. bealili-care strategies

co,nbined with heavy manual work during pregnancy result in low
weight babies with impaired chances of survival and high rates of
tnorbidity. As we have already noted in Chapter 7. the extremely high
rates of infant and child n1ortality in The Gambia were attributed by
the World Bank ( 1980) to 'the unsatisfactory situation of their
mothers, who usually are badly n<>urished and heavily overworked' (p.
19). In fact, around 18 per cent of children born in the developing
world are of low birth weight, with the highest percentages recorded
for Southern Asia followed by sub-Saharan Africa. Breast-milk
production is also likely to be inferior in malnourished mothers with
detri,nental consequences for infant nutrition and immunity to
infection. Furthermore. evidence exists to suggest that a significant
proportion of infants whose mothers die are likely to die before the
age of one ((:hen et al., 1974). Maternal health care is therefore a
logical precondition to children's welfare. However, maternal health
should not only be seen as a necessary adjunct to children's health. It is,
ah<>ve all, an end in itself. An estimated 500,000 maternal deaths occur

ratios of over 800 deaths per 100,000 live births in West Africa, to 55
per 100,000 live births in East Asia, and around 10 in the industria
lized countries (Graham et al., 1989). Put differently. a woman's
lifetime chances of pregnancy-related death vary from I in 19 in East
and West Africa, to l in 34 in south and west Asia, to l in 722 in East
Asia, to l in 2,089 in Europe (Black, 1987). Whereas a child in the
developing world suffers a risk of death approximately four to ten
times higher than that of a child in Western Europe or North America,
a pregnant woman in the Third World bears approximately fifty to
one hundred times the risk of her counterpart in the developed world
(Winikoff, 1988). Moreover, figures on maternal deaths are likely to be
underestimates (Rosenfield and Maine, 1985). In the US, official data
on maternal mortality are thought to be an underestimate by 20 to 30
per cent. Inaccuracies in the Third World are likely to be even higher.
In any case, maternal deaths are just one aspect of the unnecessary
suffering that follows from the neglect of women's reproductive
health. While data on morbidity rates are rarely available, Rosenfield
and Maine point out that 'it is certain that for every woman who dies,
many more have serious long-term complications' (p. 83). One
estimate claims that for every maternal death that would be prevented
by greater attention to reproductive health facilities, at least ten
women would avoid serious health impairment from illness and
complications (Black, 1987). Some conditions arise directly from
pregnancy: haemorrhage, pregnancy-related hypertension, obstructed
labour, toxaemia. Others are exacerbated by pregnancy: anaemia,
heart disease, renal disease, malaria. Female circumcision is another
cause of avoidable sexual and birth trauma and maternal morbidity in
particular countries. Strong arguments have been put forward for
contraceptive usage as a means of reducing maternal mortality (Black,
1987; Herz and Measham, 1987). Given that deaths from botched
abortions constitute around 25 per cent of all maternal deaths, while
hospitalization costs for complications from abortions represent a
heavy drain on scarce health resources, legalization of abortion would
go far towards eliminating this source of risk. The other maternal
mortality risk factors associated with reproductive activity have been
summarized by Sadik as 'too young, too old, too many and too close'
( 1989, p. 11 ):
• Very young age at pregnancy increases the chance of maternal
deaths. Studies indicate that pregnancies to girls under 15 resulted
in maternal mortality rates five to seven times higher than that in the
20-24 age group.

• High parity pregnancies are more likely to result in the mother·~
death than low parity ones; sixth and subsequent binhs caused

Fan1ily planning will clearly have a role to play in reducing maternal
n1ortality rates in the sense that the risk of dying from pregnancy
related con1plications is likely to be less if there are fewer pregnancies
in a p<>pulation. But reduced fertility rates do not in then1selves lo~·er
the risk of dying fron1 pregnancy in the san1e population. This is
clearly dernonstrated in findings based on the efficient demographic
surveillance system in the Matlab district in Bangladesh (Koenig et al.,

·rhe authors of the study concluded that maternal n1ortality remains a

·rhe risks associated with pregnancy are only partly reduced by
greater targeting of fan1ily-planning services to the high-risk categor·
ies of potential mothers. As noted earlier, uncertain rates of continua
tion and effectiveness an1<>ng contraceptive users mean that both
fan1ily-planning acceptors and non-acceptors will continue to have
need for reproductive health-care services to reduce maternal rnortal·
ity and morbidity. Indeed, certain forms of farnily planning may
themselves increase reprc>ductive risk if adequate screening, counsell
ing, clinical care and follow-up procedures are not pan of the
programme. Family planning is ther efo re only one element in a
broader intervention strategy designed to ensure the prevention of
unwanted pregnancies and the protection of women's health during
wanted ones.

·raylor and Berelson, ( 1971 ), the advantages of a health-backed family
planning service would be that:
• it would provide information and family-planning services through
a trusted and knowledgeable system of care with broad and
integrated health concerns;
• it could identify and offe r services to women most at risk from
further pregnancies;
• it has optimal chances of follow-up care and continuing services
from the same professional personnel with healthful consequences
for both mother and child;
• it could work towards a comprehensive system of vital registration;
• the personnel (midwives, physicians with obstetrical and gynaeco
logical training, community health workers), the facilities, examin
ing rooms and instruments needed for family planning work, are
similar to those needed f<>r MCH services, so there are important
potential economies of scale.
As Taylor and Berelson stress, the prerequisite for all endeavours in
the family-planning/MCH field is 'an infrastructure competent to
direct and provide relevant information and services to the people' (p.
22). The World Bank Safe Motherhood proposal points out that the
reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity, like all aspects of
primary health care, requires a tiered system of health-service
provision with as much emphasis as possible on prevention or early
treatment of health problems. However, each element of the system
must be effective since no health-care programme can really work
through action at one level only. In addition, to incorporating a user's
perspective, there needs to be sufficient attention to both primary and
clinical facilities for an effective reproductive health-care system. 'fwo
interrelated elements emerge as the basis for such a system.
The first is the establishn1ent of community-based care through the
organization of outreach networks in the community consisting, for
example, of satellite and mobile clinics, user groups, community
health workers and traditional village n1idwives, all of whom could be
mobilized to provide backup in the referral and educational functions
of the health service. While a number of programmes to train
traditional birth attendants are underway, they are often one-off
efforts and their emphasis on 'technical know-how' with<>ut sufficient
explanation of 'technical know-why' means that the lessons imparted
are rapidly forgotten; more systematic follow-up training might help
to avoid this.:i The second entails ensuring access to clinic-based

Beyond Reproduction: The Broader Context of
Women's Lives
1·he p<lli<·y n1easures suggested so far fall mainly within the domain of
repr<>ductive rights and well-being. Each set of recommendations
seeks t<> broaden the fol'us of population programmes: the expansion
of repr<>ductive choices through co,nprehensive provision of safe
contraceptive ,nethoos; the greater involvement of men in the
responsibilities of planned reproouction and parenthood; and a
greater concern for maternal health to complement the present focus
on family planning and children's welfare. This final section puts
forward a number of reron1mendations which should belong in any
long-term population planning, but which go beyond immediate
reproouctive health concerns.
It is important to bear in mind that n1aternal health and well-being
requires attention to women's status long before they become preg
nant. A woman's ability to lead a healthy. active life, to bear healthy
active children, to choose from a range of pr<>ductive roles, and to
decide the timing of significant life events will depend very crucially on
the kinds of constraints she has to operate under. In a graphic, stylized
account, Winikoff ( 1988) illustrates how the constraining factors that
help t<> perpetuate women's low status, high fertility and maternal
mortality/n1orbidity rates across generations are closely intertwined
and have to be dealt with simultaneously. The interaction of class and
gender inequality makes a young girl, particularly one from a poor.
rural household, more likely to suffer from ill-health, anaemia,
malnutrition and illiteracy than a young boy. 1·ypically, she is likely to
be endowed with fewer resources and opportunities to take care of
herself; she is unlikely to be able to acquire new skills and training later
on in her life and will have lin1ited possibilities of employn1ent to

bearing. She will have less access than a woman from a wealthier
background to reproductive technology. and to reliable health services
during pregnancy and delivery. If she survives, 1he inadeqmue care
and nulrition she received during her pregnancies put her and her
children at risk of cominuing J><X>r health. And if any of her children
are girls, then the cycle of female disadvantage and high rates of
fenili1y and mortality arc likely to be reproduced.
The MCH measures rcomunended in the previous sec1ions relate
only to women in the reproductive age group, when in fact much
earlier ime1·ven1ion in a woman's life cycle is needed to break the cycle
of disadvamage. As far as health policy is concerned, 1here is a case for
making womm's hc;1lth, rather than maternal he;1lth per se, 1he main
focus of policy. A health-care policy that only recognizes women in
their capacity as reproducers is unlike!)' to promole a social perception

REVERS[U REALITIES
Since W<)lllen's lirnited access to education is frequently the product of
deep-rooted gender discrimination, there is a strong case for policies
which counter this bias. In addition to improving and expanding the
physical infrastructure and equipment available for education, educa
tional provision could be made more favourable to female enrolment.
lrnproving the recruitment and training of female teachers might be a
p<>sitive step in some cultures. Another critical measure is the reform
of the f<>rmal school curriculum to reflect more accurately the roles
and opportunities available to women and girls in a changing world.
The educational system is, after all, a primary and early medium
through which s<>eial 'rules' and practices around gender for both boys
and girls are forn1ed. (;iven parents' reluctance to educate girl
children, particularly in the context of scarce resources, some govern
n1ents have attempted to increase the incentive to encourage greater
female participation in sch<)Ols. Food-for-education schemes (along
the lines of food-for-work schemes) could be implemented utilizing
the comparative advantages of both governmental and non-govern
mental agencies in order to encourage women and girls to attend
educational centres. Another possibility, being tried out in Bangla
desh, is provision of female scholarships to overcome parental bias
towards daughters' education. Finally there are innovative outreach
prograrnmes for won1en's literacy, such as Mahila Samakhya in India,
which attempt to use education as a tool for emp<>werment (Batliwala,
1992).
However, the full potential of education for enhancing women's
autonomy cannot be realized without addressing their financial
dependence. We have noted that n1arginal income-generating projects
for wornen, characteristic of official WID p<>licy in the early years, did
little l<> irnprove women's status and were frequently not even
economically viable. The rising rates of female labour-force participa
tion in export-oriented manufacturing and in micro enterprises
suggest that, where opportunities exist, women will participate in a far
wider range of jobs than envisaged by policymakers in the past. If
won1en's autonomy and bargaining power is to be enhanced, it is
important that future policy broaden the employment options avail
able to them. Like n1en, women need well-paid and secure jobs and, as
l<>ng as they are entrusted with primary resp<>nsibility for child care,
they need the additional facilities and support services that will make
this possible. ·rhese include adequate maternity leave. retraining

provided for at the workplace, motherhood may continue to represent
the only feasible route to self-realization open to many women.
The third critical, and related, element in policies for gender equity
relate to women's collective mobilization around their needs and
interests. A stress on group approaches and social-action programmes
is increasingly found in studies concerned with gender equity in the
development process (Sen and Grown, 1985; Wignaraja, 1990; Com
monwealth Secretariat, 1989). Some of these initiatives will be dis
cussed in greater detail in the next chapter, but it is worth noting here
that, while there are limits to the extent to which official policymakers
can directly empower women, they can play an important enabling
role by supporting innovative initiatives that address the crucial issues
of women's rights. All of the three elements - education, employment
and org~ni~_!ig_~ _- identified here are necessa.ry; but· not sufficient· in
themselves, to the longer-term goal of women's empowerment. In
combination, however, they will go a long way towards ensuring
women a more equal place in the development process and to building
the preconditions for a greater balance between the planet's human
and natural resources.
Conclusion
,·he measures recommended in this chapter are intended to inform a
population policy that is guided by a concern with women's reproduct
ive choice and well-being. Some of the measures proposed represent a
rethinking of past interventions and can therefore be implemented
with resources released from other areas of population programmes.
For instance, a reallocation of resources could be used to fund
recommended new areas of research and to expand the mix of birth
control methods on offe r. With certain other measures, such as the
provision of legal and safe menstrual regulation and abortion facilities,
the immediate burden of the costs might have to be shared by the
public sector instead of being borne by individuals alone, but the
longer-run burden on the health service of dealing with the complica
tions of botched abortions would be diminished.
However, it is important to stress that women's health and
reproductive needs are not, and cannot be, costless. This brings us to
what Fraser sees as the final 'moment' in the politics of needs
interpretation, which is the struggle over resources. A sustainable
population policy predicated on a respect for women's reproductive
health, rights and choices cannot be done on the cheap. The argument
that feminist health activists frequently encounter is that resources are

Empowerment from Below:
Learning from the Grassroots
[M]any victims learn to be helpless, as women often do,
which allows them to evade the conscious status of victim
hood but at an awful cost to themselves. (Shklar, 1990, p. 39)
[P]eople, especially poor women, are capable of pron1oting
their own development if their own efforts and initiatives
are recognized and supported. T he first steps must be to
build the 'infrastructures', the context in which women can
feel some sense of control over their lives'. (Antrobus, 1987,
p. 112)
Introduction
Along with the dominant paradigms within the development field,
there have always existed alternative ways of viewing development
which have evolved oul of grassrools experience. Whal distinguishes
these alternative views is thal they are based on close, face-lo-face
interaction between organizations and their constituencies so that
ideas and policies are shaped in the crucible of everyday practice
rather than in the upper echelons of remote and rule-bound bureau
cracies. Empowerment is one such contribution from the grassroots. ll
signals a recognition by those working at the local level that, despite the
rhetoric of participatory development, the power lo define priorities
remains where il has always been, in the hands of a minority at the top.
, ·he idea of empowerment expresses the interests of lhe
disenfranchised groups of society and, as Shetty ( 1991) points oul, it
represents a confluence of experiences at the grassroots. An early

usage is to be f<>und in the An1erican Black radicalism of the 1960s. It
has also been e1nployed by com,nunity developn1ent groups in the
[\i<>rth as v.'ell as the South. Finally, en1powerment has been identified
as a key goal of fe1ninist grassro<,ts organizations that want lo move
beyon<l the WID f<>eus on forn1al equality with 111en. 'fhe concept has
travelled beyond the grassroots. ·rhe 111ajor international development
agencies now routinely refer in their policy declarations lo the
en1powern1ent of the p<>0r and of women. However, there is no
consensus on the meaning of the term and it is frequently used in a way
that robs it of any political meaning, son1etimes as no more than a
substitute word for integration or participation in processes whose
n1ain parameters have already been set elsewhere (Shetty, 1991).

of the p0<>r, of women, of ethnic n1inorities - there has been a shift
away from this locution because of its static connotations. Moreover,
powerlessness suggests a total absence of power whereas in reality even
those who appear to have very little power are still able to resist. to
subvert and son1etin1es to transforn1 the conditions of their lives. The
focus has theref<>re shifted to the n1ore pr<>eessual aspects of power -

en1p<>wern1ent. l'his is the question I want to explore in this chapter. I
want to exa1nine some theoretical concepts of power in relation to
gender and then to consider how our understanding of power might
be enriched through a study of grassroots atten1pts to operationalize
en1power1nent for won1en.
Gender and Power in the Social Sciences
A useful theoretical discussion of power is to be found in Lukes' s Power:
A Radical ViPW ( 1974 ) which distinguishes between three different
interpretations commonly found in the social-science literature. 1 ·he
first, which he describes as 'the p<>wer to', is closely asS<>eiated with
liberal forms of analysis and is concerned with decision-making on
issues over which there is an obseroable conflict. It defines power as the
capacity of an actor to affect the pattern of outcomes against the wishes
of other actors and asks the question 'who prevails in decision
making?' (p. 15 ). ·rhis notion of power as interpersonal decision
making capacity underpins a great deal of the WID literature. It is
evident, for instance. in attempts to measure the statistical frequency

EMPOWERMENT FROM BELOW
with which women and men make decisions in different areas of
household activity and to demonstrate that women are likely to
exercise greater decision-making power in households where they
have access to income. Such findings have been used to bolster WID
advocacy for greater access for women in development. In practice,
however, while these efforts may have succeeded in generating access
to income-generating projects for women, few have transformed their
position within the household.
One problem is that power analysed solely in terms of individual
decision-making fails to capture those aspects which lie outside
observable decision-making processes. A broader view of power would
focus not only on the enactment of decisions, but also on exclusion of
certain issues from the decision-making agenda, so that they are
suppressed from being 'decisionable' (Giddens, 1979, p. 90). Power in
this view no longer rests only in the ability of some actors to initiate,
decide and veto decisions, but also in their ability to confine decision
making to 'safe' issues. Conflict may not be observed simply because it
has not been permitted to surface in the arena of decision-making;
however, inaction on issues or 'non-decisionmaking' can also be seen as
a manifestation of power. This 'power over' (as Lukes terms it) inheres
in the implicitly accepted and undisputed procedures within institu
tions which, by demarcating decisionable from non-decisionable
issues, systematically and routinely benefit certain individuals and
groups at the expense of others (Bachrach and Baratz, 1962).
Shifting focus in this way from the interpersonal exercise of power
to its institutionalized basis comes closer to the way in which power has
been conceptualized in the analysis of gender relations offered in
earlier chapters. Our discussion of the household division of labour,
for instance, highlighted the extent to which the assignment of
domestic responsibilities to women is so deeply institutionalized in
household rules and practices that it appears non-negotiable. Women
who wish to take up employment can only do so by cutting down on
their leisure or withdrawing children from school. They rarely do so
by renegotiating the division of labour so that husbands undertake a
greater share of domestic chores. Similarly, while women may
successfully bargain over certain aspects of household expenditure.
what remains non-negotiable is men's overall control over household
land, capital and other valued resources.
However, the household is by no means the only institutional arena
in which male power is exercised through the rnobilization of biased
norms, rules and procedures. Public organizations are also implicated.
Staudt ( 1985) makes this point in relation to the deeply entrenched
norms within public policy concerning the inviolability of the don1estic

organizational basis of these puhlic bodies. Confor1nity is safer and
carries more tangible re\\·ards. ·rhis is pointed out by Goetz ( 1992) in
her review of the experien<·e of senior "'on1en in hureaucratic

organ1zat1ons:
For n1any of these wo1ne11, sutress is hoth a function and expression of their

iousness of individual rareer positions, and their eflertive 'minority status·

14)
An institutional, rather than purely interpersonal, analysis of n1ale
power draws attention to the gender biases implicit within the rules
and practices of different s0<:ial institutions. Overt discrimination or
patriarchal conspiracies are unnecessary when n1ale privilege can be
assured sin1ply by mobilizing routine institutional procedures. How
ever, h<lth notions of power outlined so far deal with conflicts of
interest which have been identified and articulated, even if lhey are
then suppressed. Where there is no evidence of conHict, the presump
tion is that consensus prevails. ·rhe assumption is that power and
conHict are necessarily linked. There is no room here for the idea that
'interests might be unarticulated or unobservable. and above all. for
the idea thal people ,night be mistaken about, or unaware of, their own
interests' (Lukes. I 9i4 , p. 14 ). l~u kes offers a third dimension of power
to address this gap. one which encompasses, but goes beyond, the
previous two. It rel·ognizes that conflicts of interest may be suppressed
not only from the decision-making agenda, but also from the
consciousness of the various parties involved. Po\\·er relations are kept

in place because the actors involved - both dominant and subordin
ate - subscribe to accounts of social reality which deny that such
inequalities exist or else assert that they are due to individual
misfortune rather than social injustice (Shklar, 1990). This formula
tion of power is concerned with 'the socially structured and culturally
patterned behaviour of groups, and practices of institutions' (Lukes,
1974, p. 22) which help to shape not only whose interests will prevail
but also how different actors perceive their interests. It prevents
conflicts between dominant and subordinate groups from becoming
manifest by shaping wants, needs and preferences in such a way that
both accept their role in the existing order 'either because they can see
or imagine no alternative to it, or because they value it as divinely
ordained and beneficial'. Power relations may appear so secure and
well-established that both subordinate and dominant groups are
unaware of their oppressive implications or incapable of imagining
alternative ways of 'being and doing'.
There is considerable overlap between this third dimension of
power and what feminists have called 'the power within'. The feminist
analysis draws attention to the fact that, while resources provide the
material levers through which gender asymmetries are sustained,
social rules, norms, values and practices play a critical role in
concealing the reality and pervasiveness of male dominance and
defusing gender conflict. Research into household relations in a
'gentrifying area of North London' offers interesting insights into this
aspect of power in an urban industrialized context (Wilson, 1991 ). It
notes that all the women interviewed appeared to subscribe to the
dominant ideology of equality of shares within marriage, but the
majority were reluctant to talk about the actual division of intra
household resources. The problem lay in calculating individual shares.
Very few of the women were able to give accurate accounts of their
husbands' personal expenditures: 'It was clear that in yirtually all
marriages there was a conspiracy of silence in an area where inspection
would have challenged the dominant ideology of marriage- the shares
were not fair' (p. 33). Wilson comments that most of the women
preferred not to acknowledge conflict as an aspect of daily life so that
the unequal nature of material shares within marriage became in
effect a no-go area.
Women may find it strategic to avoid or defuse potentially conflic
tual situations with men because they recognize that the rules of the
game are loaded against them and the costs of confrontation are likely
to be high. Or, as the opening quotation from Shklar suggests, they
may learn helplessness in order to avoid facing the terrible implica
tions of their disempowerment. It is this aspect of power that Sen is

getting at when he suggests that women are less likely to secure
favourable outcon1es for the,nselves in household decision-n1aking
processes because their longer-tern1 security lies in subordinating their
personal well-being to that of n1ale authority figures. This may be a
conscious strategy or it n1ay reflect women's actual evaluation of their
own self-worth. ·rhe injustice of such a state of affairs will not be self
evident if it is presented as the only, the natural or the unalterable way
to be. Power thus has an irreducible subjective aspect to it (Shklar,
1990).
Recognition of the co,nplexity of wornen's experience of gender
subordination explains Molyneux's point ( 1985) that 'the relationship
between what we have called strategic gender interests and women's
recognition of them and desire to realize them cannot be assumed.
Even the "lowest con1mon denominator" of interests (e.g. complete
equality with men, control over reproduction, and greater personal
autono,ny and independence fron1 men) are not readily accepted by
all women' (p. 234). '[here is, of course, the danger with the idea that
strategic interests are not transparent, even to women themselves, of
posing a 'false consciousness' against the standard of some objectively
given set of interests. While Molyneux acknowledges this might be a
factor, she also suggests that changes realized in a piecemeal fashion
can threaten women's short-term practical interests or entail losses
which are not compensated for and are likely to be resisted by women
then1selves. Attempts at empowerment have to take note of the trade
offs that women make in order to cope with the ramifications of
oppressive relationships in their lives.
'There are other reasons why positing non-transparency of strategic
gender interests does not necessarily imply false consciousness on the
part of women. Interests emerge out of different dimensions of social
life, but they are always rooted in experience. Some emerge out of the
routine practices of daily life - women's practical gender interests are
relatively clear cut. Others are only likely to become discernible
through engagement in different kinds of practice, which bring about
a new basis for experience and knowledge from which to reassess the
old one. It is the very restrictions on women's life choices that help to
curtail their ability to 'know' other ways of being and to engage in the
analytical process by which their structural, rather than individual,
interests as a subordinated category come more clearly into view.
Women may be aware of the circumscribed nature of their lives
without necessarily knowing what to do about it. This awareness is
implicit in some of the metaphors women use to describe themselves:
in the South Asian context, for instance, women describe themselves as
fr<>gs in a well or as oxen blindly turning the grindstone, to emphasize

the limitations they see on their vision of the world. A deductive
analysis can help sketch out in broad brush strokes the main structural
mechanisms by which women's subordination is maintained and
reconstituted in specific contexts, but the 'power from within' ulti
mately entails the experiential recognition and analysis of these issues.
Such power cannot be given; it has to be self-generated.
Power, then, is seen to be more fluid, more pervasive and more
socially embedded than the conventional focus on individual decision
making would suggest. Power lies not only in men's ability to mobilize
material resources from a variety of arenas in order to promote their
individual and gender interests, but also in their ability to construct the
'rules of the game' in ways that disguise the operations of this power
and construct the illusion of consensus and complementarity. Con
sequently, while women may successfully pursue their ends, and
manage quite significantly to constrain men in the process it is still the
case that their goals are likely to be shaped by social systems which
deny them ready access to the social privilege. authority, and esteem
enjoyed by men of an equivalent class. ·
The multidimensional nature of power suggests that empowerment
strategies for women must build on 'the power within' as a necessary
adjunct to improving their ability to control resources, to determine
agendas and make decisions. In the rest of this chapter, I will be
examining grass roots efforts to empower poor women, using ex
amples from South Asia, in order to give the concept a more
operational meaning. This does not mean that the official agencies of
development are incapable of taking on aspects of women's empower
ment; nor does it mean that empowerment is only relevant to the poor.
However, bureaucratic institutions are weighed down by their own
histories, by the legacy of rules, practices and ideologies they have
inherited from the past. Given the complexity, weight and class bias of
such institutions, it is the poor that have been hardest to reach.
Grassroots non-governmental organizations tend to be less rule
governed and their face-to-face interactions with their constituencies
have given them both a greater advantage in promoting innovative
strategies and less scope for sidestepping the issue of women's
subordination.

in1proving their entitlements to basic resources. l 'he first stage in tht
design of such interventions is therefore identifying and prioritizing
basic needs. However. as we noted in the previous chapter, this is nol a
neutral process, but one fraught with the 'politics of needs interpreta
tion'. l'hr<>ugh what conceptual and methodological lenses do plan
ners 'see' needs? Do they share or have empathy with the experienc~
of those whose needs they are defining? Who has the last word in
determining the legitimacy of a particular need within the 'decision

There is a story that Schumacher is supp<>sed to have told to a
conference he once attended I which serves as a poignant allegorJ for
the disen1powering implications of top-down approaches to poven,

she thinks I am real.' Different n1eanings can of course be read into an
anecdote like this, but for me it illustrates quite graphically the
disernpowering and infantilizing ways in which policymakers have
frequently treated the poor, particularly poor women. By and large,
inasrnuch as poverty alleviation has addressed the needs of the poor,
policyn1akers have tended to prioritize men's needs over women's.
Women are rarely treated as knowing what they need; rather, agencies
seek to think and act on their behalf. Either women's needs and
priorities are subsumed (and then forgotten) within those of the
household collectivity or, when they are addressed separately, they
tend to fall in the category of won1en's practical gender needs as
mothers, wives and carers within the fan1ily.
What emerges from the experience of the innovative NGOs is tha1

make visible hitherto hidden categories of women's needs and to lay
bare the interconnections between different aspects of women's lives.
The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh offers an example of how the use
of participatory methodologies throws up very different needs and
priorities from those which arise out of 'expert'-led analysis. Grameen
started out as a poverty-eradication project in 1976 as the result of the
findings of action research on poverty carried out by Md Yunus, a
professor at Chittagong University. By adopting a participatory and
open-ended methodology, the research helped to counter many
conventional preconceptions about the rural poor which were en
shrined in the development literature in Bangladesh: that they were
primarily landless wage labourers; that their poverty resulted from
inadequate access to waged labour; and that they were (implicitly) men
(Sultan, 1992). The research revealed instead that the rural poor
earned their livelihoods from a variety of self-employed activities
rather than relying solely on wage labour, and that their major
constraint was the lack of access to financial institutions rather than to
the waged labour market. The research also helped to spell out the
gender dimension of poverty: it drew attention to women's key
contribution in household livelihood strategies among the poor and
their greater tendency to devote their incomes to family. rather than
personal, welfare. It was evident that self-employment was more
important for women, given the paucity of waged-labour opportuni
ties open to them. Yet in terms of access to credit, they were, if
anything, more disadvantaged than poor men.
Beginning as a small credit programme in 1976, Grameen became
an independent national bank in 1983. Its strategy of providing credit
t<> the poor and landless sought to release the potential contained in
their survival skills; it would permit them to move beyond coping
strategies by expanding their enterprises and moving into new
activities. Grameen is best known today for its success in reaching
credit to poor and assetless women. While it started by lending
primarily to men, a policy decision to favour women resulted in them
forming an increasing percentage of its borrowers since 1983. Today
women constitute over 90 per cent of bank borrowers.
The Self Employed Women's Association in India also works with
poor self-employed women but, unlike Grameen, it works primarily in
urban areas. It emerged in response to the expressed needs of women
workers in the unorganized sector who had largely been ignored by
the male-dominated trade-union movement. While the union had set
up a Women's Wing in 1954, it targeted women only through their
relationship to male mill workers. 'fhe work of the wing was in the
classic welfarist mode. By 1968 it was offering classes in sewing,

'The other issue that has remained submerged until recently is that
of domestic violence. Here again, deep-rooted beliefs about the
sanctity and safety of the domestic sphere, the shame and blame that
often attach to women who are beaten, and the male biases of most
development agencies have long combined to ensure that this was an
issue largely characterized by silence and non-decisionmaking. The
significance of organizational practice in allowing domestic violence to
surface within the decision-making agenda is described in Price's
( 1992) case study of SUTRA, which began working in Himachal
Pradesh in 1977. In its early years, SUTRA worked within the pre
existing government model of service delivery, concentrating on
improving on the efficiency of government targeting and delivery of
services and hoping thereby to encourage demands within the local
population for improved services from the government. Its targeting
practices displayed fairly conventional gender biases: the services for
men aimed at improving agricultural production and enhancing
market access, while those for women aimed at their fa n1ilial and
domestic roles. An internal review in 1984 raised fundamental
questions about the nature of the organization and its achievements in
bringing about social change. It was recognized that women expressed
greater support for the organization because they saw it as providing a
space of their own which was not permitted to them elsewhere in
society. It was also recognized that merely offering more efficient
replacen1ent services had not resulted in villagers putting pressure on
the government to improve its delivery system. Consequently, SUTRA
decided to concentrate on building up women's organizations as its
main goal, with development implementation as a secondary one.
What was interesting about the shift to this new agenda was the way
i11 which it challenged earlier preconceptions and threw up previously
submerged needs. When consulted, women expressed concerns over
issues that had earlier been categorized as male areas of interest:
drinking-water supplies, irrigation schemes, teachers' n<>n-attendance
at schools, corruption among local officials. As the needs that the
women members began to articulate expanded into areas of women's
health, more women were recruited onto the hitherto largely male
staff to cope with some of the cultural barriers entailed in dealing with
such needs. "fhe increased numbers of women staff in turn brought
further problems out into the open, particularly domestic violence,
rape and alcoholism. In the early phase of the organization's life,
problems of violence against women had been generally shrouded in

difficulties, there was often a tendency to lay blame on the "·on1an

on their own or others· behalf to explore ways in which these situation~
c<>uld t>e dealt with. ·rhus issues which had been previously defined as
private acquired a public and p<>litical status in the eyes of the women.
Finally, a third aspecl of needs that comes into view if greater
participation is built into the planning process is the interdependenc,·
between different c.:a1egories of needs. particularly in the lives of
women. ·rhere is a 'magic bullei' n1en1ality an1ong many policymakers:
1he idea 1ha1 con1plex issues of gender and poverty can be dealt with
through a single 'stra1egic intervention'. In reality, however, people's
lives are such that they cannot be divided into neat compartments
which are kept insulated from each other. Rather, what occurs in any
one arena will have implications for all other arenas, sometimes to the
extent of negating the intended effects of an intervention. Con
sequently. very few of the innovative NGOs concentrate purely on the
delivery of a single 'input'. Even where they may prioritize a single
category of need, 1hey generally offer a complementary package of
resources or services to ensure the need is actuallv met. SEWA, for
,
instance, from its inception has recognized that the problems of self
ernployed women required a struggle on a nun1ber of different fronts.
Unlike the case of n1ale factory workers whose main struggle was with
a single employer, self-employed women have to confront problems
arising from exploitative contractors and n1oneylenders, police harass
ment and discriminatory laws. As we shall describe in greater detail
below, this has entailed the involvernent of SEWA in a much broader
range of activities than conventional trade unions, straddling both
developn1ent and union work. and brought it into conflict with tht"
1~extile Labour Association.
In its early years, Grameen Bank offered credit for a very narro"·
range of 'productive' activities which related to market-oriented
pr<><luction. However, it became clear that if credit was intended to
enhance household survival and security, it needed to be fungible
between different uses of won1en's tin1e, all of which contributed to the
well-being of household n1en1bers. Loans for health-related activities
could act simultaneously as a time-saving measure (since wornen had to
Google Original from
Digitized by
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA235
EMPOWERMENT FROM BELOW
take time off from economic activities to take care of the sick) as well as
an asset-preserving one (since families often had to sell off productive
assets to pay for medical treatment). Recognizing the f ungibility of
labour and resources within the household, Grameen has expanded its
loan-giving activities. Since the mid-eighties, it has sought to develop
viable borrower cooperative groups to undertake such activities as
primary health care, child nutrition, sanitation, literacy and family
planning. It is also planning to add a health programme to its activities
in view of the fact that enterprise profits are often wiped out by
expensive medical costs.
Gonoshasthaya Kendra (People's Health Centre), on the other
hand, is an NGO in Bangladesh which specializes in primary health
care provision but which also offers income-earning opportunities to
women from poorer households. This dates back to 1972 when a
woman was brought into the health centre after having tried to kill
herself by taking pesticides. She had not been able to provide the
necessary post-harvest labour for her family because she was suffering
from excessive bleeding following the use of contraceptive pills and
had been asked by her husband's family to return to her parental
home because she was proving to be a liability for a poor farming
family. When the woman regained consciousness, she told the doctor
treating her that if all that GK could do was to send her back to her
husband, they should have let her die. In other words, her life was not
worth saving if she could only live it as a liability. Recognizing that
economic dependence was one aspect of the problem that women
faced, GK began its vocational training programme, with the emphasis
on non-traditional skills (for example, metal work, carpentry, shoe
making, bakery, fibre-glass fabrication, printing, irrigation-pump
operation, repair and management). These are not only likely to have
higher financial returns, but are also seen to challenge old preconcep
tions about women's abilities and competences (Gonoshasthaya Ken
dra, 1991).
To sum up, the space given by an organization to the bottom-up
establishment of needs conveys a great deal about how it has
positioned women within its programmatic endeavours: as competent,
but socially constrained actors who are capable of making choices,
articulating priorities and taking responsibility, or as passive clients in
need of enlightenment and uplifting. Such space can be created
through the use of participatory methodologies in the process of needs
identification or by adopting open, rather than closed, decision
making processes so that organizational priorities are constantly
monitored and revised in the light of experience. The growing body of
literature on PRA can be seen as one attempt to systematize this

Compensating for lnstitutitional Failure:
Alternative Forms of Needs Satisfaction
()nee a need has been given recognition within the policy agenda of an
organization, it has to be translated into strategies for interpreting and
n1eeting the need. A rnajor factor behind women's disenfranchisemenr
within the developn1ent process has been the gender biases entrenched
within the routine rules and procedures through which mainstream
developn1ent agencies distribute resources. Except where the
resources in question correspond specifically to 'women's roles·, these
institutions have been, explicitly or i1nplici1ly, targeted at men. B,·
tailoring their rules and pr<>eedures to take cognizance of the gender
specific constraints that women from low-incorne households have 10
deal with, the innovative NGOs have sought to t·ornpensate for the
exclusionary implications of mainstream institutional practice. Their
own rules and pr<><.:edures embooy a very different set of assumptions
about potential 'beneficiaries' and result in very different modes oi
prov1s1on.
First of all, they recognize that gender inequalities in the division of
resources and responsibilities within the domestic domain create
gender inequalities in the ability to take up opportunities outside the
d<>n1estic domain. Consequently, along with 'primary' sets of 11eeds
around which their interventions are organized, the innovative NGOs
have sought to resp<>nd to secondary and interrelated sets of needs
which derive from the specific constraints that women face in accessing
n1ainstream institutional resources. And second, they have sought to
provicle this access on terms which position women as agents and
participants in the development effort rather than as clients and
recipients. This has entailed an emphasis on building a sense of

EMPOWERMENT FROM BELOW
ownership and responsibility among poor women in relation to the
organization's activities, rather than on limiting their participation to
the more instrumental and limited version of participation as the take
up of services or meeting of project targets.
A comparison of formal credit institutions and alternative modes of
credit delivery will illustrate these points. The significance of self
employment in the livelihood strategies of both rural and urban poor
has now been established in a variety of different contexts; it has also
become abundantly clear that formal financial institutions have failed
to provide them with the services that would help them to upgrade the
productivity of their enterprises. Even where such institutions have
sought to implement special credit schemes for the poor (for example,
the Uganda Commercial Bank's Rural Farmer's Scheme; see Musoke
and Amajo, 1989) and the Differential Rate of Interest scheme in
India (see Everett and Savara, 1991), women's participation in
particular has been negligible. A number of studies have pointed out
the lack of fit between the norms and procedures of mainstream
banking institutions and the circumstances and constraints of women's
lives. These include:
• The women's lack of material assets to underwrite the security of
loans.
• Inflexible procedures often entailing formidable paper work and
requiring basic literacy. A study of the Uganda credit scheme found
that the number of visits required to get loan applications processed
and approved loans disbursed was a major reason given by women
farmers for their lack of participation in the scheme (Musoke and
Amajo, 1989).
• Women's enterprises tend to be smaller and are therefore deemed
less creditworthy. Smaller loans have relatively higher administrat-
.
1ve costs.
• The costs of acquiring information about a group that is generally
more isolated and less mobile also inhibit bank lending to poor
women.
• Ambiguity of goals for employees in public financial institutions who
are required to combine conventional profit-oriented concerns in
the majority of their transactions with poverty-oriented concerns in
their loans to the poor. Incentive structures tend to reward the
former rather than the latter activity. Bank clerks involved in
'weaker section lending' to India complained that they aspired to be
bank officers rather than social workers; that involvement in such
lending did not prepare them for the bank officer examination and

• Finally, there are the less tangible <>bstacles associated with the SO(ial
distan<.:e between educated, middle-class and mainly male banl
en1ployees and p<>0r women. As we noted in Chapter 6, their
clothing and general appearance, combined with their general latl
of experience and confidence in the public domain, ensured that

banking institutions, assun1ing that they attempted it. De,•aki Jain

by bank employees to village centres helps to compensate for the
social and financial constraints on women's mobility. To put this
point quantitatively, the bank has 781 branches and a staff of 14,000
who put in 40,000 miles of legwork a day to reach its 869,538
members dispersed in 19,536 out of the country's 64,000 villages
(Huq and Sultan, 1991).
• Procedures have been simplified and form filling kept to a mini
mum. Grameen's borrowers undergo a week's training to learn to
sign their own names.
• Interest rates are set at commercial levels. Grameen believes that the
problem for the poor is lack of access rather than insolvency (Sultan,
1992). The emphasis is on subsidizing administrative costs rather
than the loans themselves. The strategy works and repayment rates
are an astonishing 98 per cent.
• The costs of information on the multiplicity of small enterprises in
which women are involved are minimized by leaving the choice of
enterprise to the individual borrower, with the final responsibility
for deciding and monitoring resting with her group members. The
only condition is that the loan must be for an activity which the
borrower can carry out herself, and it must be invested within a week
of the loan. The first seeks to ensure that the purchase of assets is not
determined by men, while the second ensures that sufficient
thought is given to the chosen enterprise before application is made
for a loan.
There are other tangible and intangible changes that Grameen has
sought to promote in the lives of women through its rules and
practices. It has special housing loans which enable poor families to
invest in durable, flood-resistant structures. Housing is an asset which
is overlaid with many different meanings. It serves a very basic need
for shelter in a flood-prone country. It is often the main site of
economic activity for people who are self-employed. But, as Huq and
Sultan ( 1991) point out, it has important psychological and symbolic
significance: 'A durable shelter is one of the basic requirements for
people to be able to organise their thoughts, discipline their actions
and undertake plans and programs for creative pursuits. People
without a home tend to be uncertain, worried and unstable, which
affects their every action' (p. 174). If the loan is given to the woman
(and the majority are), the land on which the structure is built has to be
registered in her name. As Sultan ( 1992) points out, this has some very
important implications in the context of Bangladesh. It recognizes the

protect. (:onsequently, its activities have always been more wide-

ranging than conventional male-dominated trade unions and include
legal aid, credit provision, workers' rights and representations for
higher wages and better working conditions. Union members from
various trades are organized as cooperatives to deal with exploitation
by middlemen and lack of access to raw materials and markets.
Cooperative members contribute the share capital, own the co
operative and elect a managing committee to handle its daily business.
Cooperatives have been formed around credit, crafts and artisanal
activities, livestock, trading, vending, and services like cleaning and
ragpicking. Moreover, given that its members have no access to the
social services and social security available to formal sector workers,
SEWA has organized child-care and health cooperatives, life-insur
ance schemes and maternity-benefit schemes. SEWA has now been
adopted by the Labour Ministry as a state-wide scheme for agricultural
workers (Bhatt, 1989).
SEWA encourages members to take advantage of existing provision
wherever possible, linking them to the institutions providing welfare
benefits, health services, state housing or governmental training
programmes. However, because so many institutions are closed to
poor women, SEWA has also sought to build alternative institutions for
its members. The prime example of this is SEWA bank. Initially SEWA
had sought to act as a financial intermediary between its me1nbers and
government lending schemes for poorer sections, which operated
through mainstream banks. However, the familiar problems asso
ciated with the formalized rules and practices of these institutions -
time-consuming bank procedures, needlessly complicated application
forms, banking hours and attitudes of male bank staff - soon n1ade it
clear that credit on its own was not enough. SEWA Bank was set up
using deposits and share capital from SEWA men1bers. It is staffed by
pe,>ple who are sensitive to the needs and constraints of poor women,
and its procedures, lending schemes and savings programn1es are
organized around these needs and constraints. In place of a signature,
a11 identity card and pass book are issued to each men1ber, bearing a
photograph of her holding a slate showing her account number.
Women who need a secure place to keep their passbooks can store
them in a locked cabinet in the bank. Loan appraisal and creditworthi
ness are established through personal dialogue, and decisions gener
ally take less than a week. Repayment rates are around 90 per cent.
SEWA bank operates on a comprehension of the lives of its members in
their totality rather than purely in economic and credit terms. Like

·rhe broad range of activities that SEWA undertakes in the interests
of its n1embers created considerable tension with the main body of the
·rLA. One of the 'fLA's cornplainLS against SEWA was over its
developntental activities. 'rhese were seen as hampering SE\\'A·~
trade-uni(>n functions. SEWA's argun1ent, however, has been that
since it represented unconventional workers, it had to go beyond the
conventional range of needs: 'Pressure and development or union and
co-operative - by linking the two, both the arnts [of SEWA] have been
able to uplift the worker from exploitation and unemployment' (Bhau.
1979, cited in Gandhi and Shah, I 992, p. 282). ·rensions between 1·u
and SEWA came lo the fore during the l 981 riots over the reservation
of medical college seats for students from the dalit castes. SE\\:,.\,
whose 1nembers were drawn printarily from the daliJ caste, made a
public declaration supporting the dalits. l "his went against the silent
stance adopted by the TLA, who were aligned with the National
Labour Organization, which included many members from higher
castes. SEWA was charged with indiscipline and expelled.
SEWA continues to experin1ent with the attempt to straddle both
development and union activities, to address the problems its
members face within the fa mity as well as in the marketplace, as
women as well as workers. It acknowledges women's reproducti\·e
responsibilities, l<>ng overlooked by male-dominated trade unions, and
has formed child-care and health cooperatives, often using these issues
as the basis for reaching women who have not yet been organized. h
has helped its mernbers in cases of dowry, bride-price, domestic and
sexual harassment, and rape. Its actions include meeting with women's
f amity members, filing petitions in the courts, and issuing summonses
to husbands, with the help of police escorts. Lobbying for better
legislation has also been an important aspect of SEWA's work.
A very different strategy for con1pensating for institutional failure is
that of Nijera Kori in Bangladesh. This organization was founded by a
group of development activists who left BRAC (now one of the largest
NGOs in Bangladesh) because of their disillusionment with its practice
of providing loans to the poor. Their fear was that NGO involvement
in lending to the poor would end up by substituting the old relations of
dependence and patronage involving moneylenders and landlords
with new forms of such relations with NGO staff. Because NGOs are
not politically elected or account.able (except to their donors), there are
few safeguards to ensure that they behave in responsible ways. Rather
than providing credit and other economic resources to the poor, NK's
strategy has been to seek to compensate for the failure of public
entiden1ent systems to reach poor women and men. Nijera Kori argues
that there is state con1mitment in Bangladesh to providing various

EMPOWERMENT FROM BELOW
material resources to the poor - from redistribution of /cha.s
(unclaimed, publicly owned) land and water bodies to the provision of
employment through public works schemes. What prevented disen
franchised groups from claiming their full entitlement was their lack
of political clout.
Nijera Kori avoids distributing material resources; it seeks instead to
work with more intangible resources, by building the organizational
capacity of poor people to press their claims on public institutions. Its
activities include group formation, training in human and skill
development, meetings between different groups, a legal-aid pro
gramme, and collective action and mobilization on social issues. In
terms of economic resources, priority is given to the mobilization by
the poor of their own resources and includes joint cultivation and
aquaculture supported by group savings. Nijera Kori works with both
women and men who are organized in separate groups but undertake
joint activities. Where public works programmes are undertaken or
poverty alleviation strategies implemented, Nijera Kori's group strat
egy ensures that the 'rules' of resource distribution are equitable and
effective.
Like Nijera Kori, the Women's Development Programme (WDP) in
Rajasthan avoids the direct distribution of material resources. Unlike
the other examples we have used so far, it is a joint government/NGO
effort. The WDP was set up by the government of Rajasthan in
recognition of the fact that, despite its attempt to channel resources to
women, there appeared to have been little change in their condition.
'It also took note of the fact that men had been entrusted with the
responsibility for women's development in the family. government
and society far too long' (Dighe and Jain, 1989, p. 78). It was to
compensate for the institutional failure of the local state to meet
women's needs and priorities that the WDP was set up. Its concern was
less with putting new mechanisms of delivery in place and more with
building alliances and networks that would allow poorer village
women to put collective pressure on unresponsive local institutions.
'fhe WDP was set up as a collaboration between the local government
and the Information Development and Resource Agency (IDARA), a
voluntary agency working in the field of adult education and rural
development. Monitoring and evaluation for the Programme was to be
conducted by the Jaipur Institute of Development Studies, a local
research institute. The front-level worker of the WDP was the sathin
who was responsible for formation of women's fora at the village level.
She was selected for her qualities of commitment and courage rather
than for any formal qualifications. Clusters of ten village panchayaLt
with ten sathins were coordinated by a pracheta. The government

departn1ent responsible for district-level c0<>rdination received tech
nical advice and support from IDARA.
·rhe principal airn of the WDP was 'to empower women through
con1munication of information, education and training and to enable
them to recognize and improve their social and economic status (Jain
et al., 1986, p. 6). Its strategy was to use the sathin's access to the local
bureaucracy as an important resource in meeting locally defined
needs. ,·he sathin"s role was to provide nec·essary information, to link
village wc>men up with the appropriate ofhc:ials who can deal with their
den1ands, and to organize collective responses. Jain et al. ( 1986)
provide son1e exan1ples of how this function was carried out. In Ajmer
district, the sathi11 found that the lcx:al official in charge of local famine
works was threatening to elin1inate front his list of wage earners those
women who refused to get sterilized. He had his own 'targets' to meet
because of governn1enl pressure over fan1ily planning. ·rhe sathi,1
intervened with the suppc>rl of son1e senior government officers and
the won1en were reinstated. ·rhe sathin also assisted a number of
won1en who were interested in sterilization to get the operation. Other
women in the fan1ine work helped then1 to retain their jobs by working
extra to ensure that they did not have lo undertake taxing physical
work straight after the operation. l ' he woman agreed that it was not
family planning that they objected to, but the coercive measures which
acc·on1panied it.
In Jodhpur district, the sathins mobilized women labourers to
demand minimum wages for famine works. l "hey found out that they
had been putting their thumb impressions to payments of Rs. 11 but
receiving only Rs. 3 or Rs. 4. "f"his led to a demand for literacy and
numeracy, and adult-education centres were gradually set up in a
number of the villages. In Udaipur district, a key problem identified
was alc<>h<>lism among men, which led lo widespread incidence of wife
beating. "I"he sathin was asked by the men not to interfere, although the
women had complained bitterly. A collective decision was taken in a
jajam to make alcohol consumption illegal. However, the police could
only take action against misbehaviour in public, not within the home.
·rhe issue was discussed again in the village general meeting. this time
involving the men of the village, including the village elders. "fhe
police agreed to prosecute men who consumed illicit liquor and beat
their wives. Attempts by some of the men in the village to
'excommunicate' the sathin failed because of the unanimous support of
the women.
Another kind of institutional failure is addressed by the efforts of
Saptagram, one of the few examples of an NGO in Bangladesh that is
staffed mainly by women at all levels of the organization. As such, ic

EMPOWERMENT FROM BELOW
provides a particular challenge to conventional institutions, including
other NGOs in the country, which claim that it is impossible to find
women prepared to undertake responsibility al the higher levels of
management. While most NGOs in Bangladesh today have identified
poorer women as a key target group, the number of women they
employ on their staff is very limited, and they generally do not stay
very long. In Saptagram, flexible service rules taking individual
women's family circumstances into account mean that most of the
primarily female staff stay on in the organisation, even after marriage.
Staff members are allowed to bring their children into the office or
project headquarters; time off for family responsibilities is given. In
exchange, members will work more intensively when the organization
requires it. Members are allowed to use conventional public transport
or rickshaws, rather than required to ride bicycles - a rule that has the
effect of putting off many potential women applicants to some of the
other NGOs in Bangladesh. 'fhis emphasis on recruiting committed
women staff has had the effect of slowing down Saptagram's rate of
expansion, since it can grow only as fast as it can find good female staff.
Nevertheless, in its attempt to combine feminist and development
principles, it offers a different model of organization to most other
NGOs in Bangladesh. Saptagram, as recent evaluation report
~
suggested, is not about 'including women' in development or about
'the women especially'. It is a development organization that is 'for
women' (Arn and Lily, 1992). It offers a glimpse into what would
become possible were existing institutions to adapt their rules and
practices to the needs of working women rather than requiring
working women to adapt to the logic of male-dominated institutions.
The Power Within: Transforming Consciousness
and Reinterpreting Need
We have stressed so far the importance of incorporating women's own
needs and priorities into the construction of organizational agendas.
However, current priorities reflect the current conditions of women's
lives. Different priorities n1ight come into view if women were able to
review their lives from other vantage points. Strategies of 'empower
ment from within' provide women with these other perspectives. They
entail reflection, analysis and assessment of what has hitherto been
taken for granted so as to uncover the socially constructed and socially
shared basis of apparently individual problems. New forms of
consciousness arise out of women's newly acquired access to the

intangible resources of analytical skills, social networks, organizational
strength, solidarity and sense of not being alone.
Although located outside the region we are concentrating on, Shanti
Dairiam ( l 992f' provides an excellent case study of an organization· s
atten1pt t<> build battered women's sense of control over their own
lives, the 'p<>wer within'. It illustrates the kinds of institutional norms
and practices that are adopted to achieve this goal. The Malaysian
Women's Aid Organization (WAO) was set up in 1982 to provide a
range of support services to women with violent husbands, including
shelter, counselling, legal advice and support.job placement, housing.
and so <>n. Abused won1en are given shelter by the WAO, along with
their children, for three months during which they have to decide
whether they wish to return to their husbands or to lead an
independent life. ·rhe WAO's philosophy makes the restoration of
self-esteem and autonorny to women, whose experience has badly
dan1aged these inner resources, its primary concern. It operates on the
principle that every woman has the right to self-determination.
However, many processes have to be gone through before this right is
exercised: 'She has to come to terms with what has been happening to
her within the marital relationship, unlearn the many years of
reinforcement that she is an unworthy person, that what has happened
to her is her own fault and to feel a sense of outrage at the violation of
her bodily integrity.' All WA()'s actions are geared to providing an
environment in which women feel empowered to take responsibility
for their own decisions and own lives.
W<>rnen hear ah<>ut the WAO through various forms of publicity or
they may be referred by the police, welfare departments, hospitals or
women's organizations, but they must make the approach to WAO on
their own. l"his is to ensure that they are seeking assistance of their
own volition and that they are fully aware of and prepared for the
kinds of choices and trade-offs facing thern. When a woman openly
and publicly acknowledges that she is being beaten by her husband
and that she wants to do something about it, she is laying herself open
to the risk of her husband's wrath as well as alienation from her family
and community. It may lead to ultimate separation. Only women who
have no friends or family to go to are advised to stay at the shelter.
Invariably these are poorer women. At the centre, attempts are made
to provide the women with interactions very different from the
brutalizing and self-corrosive experiences they have been through.
'fhis does not happen automatically or overnight but through a slow
and patient process. Many of the women are not accustomed to
fending for themselves in public space and even fewer have ever dealt
with public officials. They are encouraged to go out on their own.

taught bus routes and required to do their own shopping or visits to
hospital, though a companion is provided if necessary. They are
taught how to make police reports, obtain identity cards for children
who are of age, effect the transfer of children from one school to
another. They are given support, information and counselling until
they are ready to make a decision regarding their own future. WAO
helps them to implement this decision, whether it entails returning to
their husbands or leading separate lives. If it is the former, the woman
is supported in stipulating her terms and conditions for returning.
The WAO does not get involved in this process of dialogue and
negotiation. It is initiated by the woman, and the services of the state
welfare department may be sought. If the woman decides to leave,
WAO undertakes to assist her with the legal processes for separation or
divorce, maintenance and custody of children. She is also assisted with
job placement and housing.
Dairiam suggests that women's action in seeking support at the
shelter comes as a shock to many of their husbands since it may be the
first time that their wives have offered them any resistance. Men's
pride, self-esteem and sense of ownership of their wives are all
profoundly affected. Whatever the women decide to do ultimately, the
knowledge that there is an alternative safe place where they can take
refuge from the violence they experience within their marriages has
improved their bargaining power vis-a-vis their husbands. Both
parties know that if they do not negotiate an acceptable set of terms for
continuing their marriage, the woman no longer has to accept an
abusive relationship. She has a supportive institution outside her
marriage to back her if she wants to leave. For both women and men,
women's ability to resist their husbands' violence, often for the first
time in the marriage, can have a profound effect.
The extent to which other more clearly development-oriented
NGOs give explicit consideration to transforming consciousness and
the modes through which they seek to do so varies considerably.
Within the Grameen Bank, there is an emphasis on building new
collective identities for women through the process of group forma
tion. Fuglesang and Chandler ( 1986) describe this approach: 'Quite
simply it means to stand together and to move together, to have an
intention together and to act together in pursuit of that intention.'
They also emphasize the interpersonal dynamics involved in the
process. 'Such a formation is expressed both in physical or spatial
arrangements and in the thinking, the feeling, the attitudes and the
behaviour of the participants, right down to their body language. Most
significantly, it is a social design in which people participate in making
themselves socially and economically accountable to each other' (p. 52).

·rhis en1phasis on physical deportment explains the role assigned to
exercise and discipline within Grctmeen organizational culture. Meet

exercise, shouting of slogans and recitation in unison of the Sixteen
Decisions. In the context of Bangladesh, where men monopolize the
use of public space, where women's bodies are invested with beliefs
about p<>llution and shame, the emphasis on freedom of body
movement has a certain logic. Nevertheless, its form and mode of
delivery speak of its origins in a certain class-based view of what
constitutes en1powerment; it has not evolved from below. It is also a
'male' model of emp<>wermenl in that it is masculine deportment and

a view to improving women's longer-term access lo more tangible
resources, particularly those distributed by the state. In contrast to the
bias towards tangible, quantifiable performance indicators displayed
in conventional planning ('such as, so many children immunized, so
many made literate, so many given bank loans etc.' Dighe and Jain,
1989, p. 92), the WOP seeks to redefine 'work' to include these more
intangible resources: support, solidarity and empowerment. Dighe
and Jain ( 1989) note how one WDP pracheta struggled to come to terms
with this novel approach to development work:
Didi. we often feel desperate that we cannot see our work. We cannot
rneasure the trust and confidence that we have established with the people.
Everything appears so fluid. We go to the Regar women. sit with them and
talk to them. It is gradually becoming clear that the dirt and tilth for which
we despised them is a result of sheer poverty. Now we sit and eat with them
and can see why their priorities are different. But I still wonder, is this
measurable work? (Prachtta's report. J\jmer District, June 1985)
Continuous training forms the backbone of the programme and
considerable emphasis is given to the training of the sathins who form
the basic support network for poorer women in the villages and
provide them with a channel of communication with state institutions.
, ·raining takes place through jajams, the monthly meeting of the
sathin.s, organized at the village level, and shivirs, three-day camps
organized around specific problems identified by women within a
district. What is distinctive about WDP's training approach is its
emphasis on that neglected dimension in n1ost developn1enl efforts -
the self. WDP is concerned with the transformation of 'the self as the
key route to women's self-en1powerment. It seeks to generate experi
ences which strengthen women's sense of selfhood as well as their
perceptions of their place in society. 'Far from being lectures on
"cleanliness", "nutrition", and "child-development", the training pro
grammes experiment with the possibility of creating a climate of
questioning, reflecting, sharing, choosing, seeking and discovering'
(Jain el al., I 986, p. I 3). Detailed attention is given to every aspect of
interaction during training programmes, including physical arrange
ments, modes of communication, and the content of the training itself,
since each element is seen as a part of the process for rethinking the
sense of self that participants bring into any development programme.

A rather different approach to issues of individual consciousness is
that of 'conscientization' as an explicitly political act which forms the
basis of the learning processes embodied in Freire's 'pedagogy for the
oppressed'. Developed in Latin America, these have been adopted and
adapted to a variety of different contexts. The Freirean conscientiza
tion process seeks to turn literacy into a political act. While seeking to
conscientize through literacy training. it is not illiteracy that is seen as
the main problem, but the underlying structures that sustain it.
Consequently, teaching literacy may merely have a domesticating
function, helping the oppressed to adapt better to the conditions of
their oppression. As James ( 1990, p. 24) points out, many organiza
tions claim 'ingenuous literacy visions', borrowing the political lan
guage of transformative literacy but leaving behind the theory.
A number of South Asian organizations (including both Saptagram
and N~jera Kori) working with the landless have adopted and adapted
Freire's ideas to their local contexts. Their strategy is to build the
organizational capacity among landless women and men on the basis
of a conscientization process in order that they will mobilize around
their self-defined priorities and concerns. If the poor lack the material
and political clout to challenge the structure and distribution of

EMPOW1':RMENT FROM BELC>W
entitlements in their society, then conscientization and organization
are seen as mobilizing the only resources they do have: their capacity to
resist and transform through their collective strength. lt could be said
that Saptagram's commitments to run a development organization
1nainly for women, with a primarily female staff in a society where men
have typically monopolized institutional power, space and resources,
itself signals the significance given to transformatory ways of perceiv
ing and doing development. In addition, conscientization through
adult-education classes is an important component in its approach.
·rhis takes place through a learning-teaching format in which literacy
is taught, not through the convention of using words that have little
relevance to the everyday lives of poor people, but rather through
dialogue around words and themes that have a deep resonance. These
may include class-based themes such as wages, landlords, property, as
well as gender-based ones such as dowry, wife-beating, divorce and
land rights. The discussions generated allow participants in the
training programmes to analyse and question the realities behind
these everyday words, to construct alternative visions, and to reflect on
the strategies by which these visions might be brought closer. The act
of moving beyond acceptance of structures which are so pervasive and
deep-rooted that they becon1e invisible to the exploration of how these
structures are sustained - and who they benefit - is seen as a
politicizing process.
Another important element in this continuing process of building
awareness is expanding women's mobility. Women's lives within rural
society have been extremely circumscribed in both physical and social
terms. As we noted earlier, they frequently liken themselves to oxen
turning the grindstone, treading an endless cycle of drudgery, blind to
the world beyond. Saptagram organizes group meetings in different
village centres so that n1embers from different parts of the region can
exchange information and share experiences. Such travel plays an
important role in breaking down the sense of isolation and powerless
ness that women are often trapped in.
A final, and again different, example of an atte1npt to en1power
rural women through a political understanding of their problems is
the Bankura experiment, an association between CWDS, a research
group, and samilis (groups) of poor women in West Bengal (Mazum
dar, 1989). These groups were organized around reclamation of waste
land donated to them by fellow villagers. ·rhis part of Bankura district
had few opportunities for wage labour, so that seasonal migration was
a critical aspect of the survival strategies of poor and assetless families.
In response to demands for work locally expressed at a meeting of
women agricultural labourers, the West Bengal Minister for Land

Reforn1 brought in the {:WDS in an advisory role. While CWDS
emphasized the self-organization of the poor, it also saw a role for a
middle-class women's group in setting up the first channels of
communication between poorer rural women's organizations and the
wider structures of decision-n1aking within development. Thev
stressed the value <>f such strategic coalitions as a way of overcoming
some of the constraints that poorer woman faced.
A critical resource promoted by CWDS was professional manage
ment training to enable the women to manage their enterprises. This
was provided through training workshops on a quanerly basis for a
year tor the same group of women. ·rraining was seen by the CWDS
organizers both as human resource development but also as a
politicizing technique. In the words of the director, 'Wage labour
displays a psychology of dependence on work-givers. This is reflected
in their language. ·rhe psychology of entrepreneurship and self
reliance represents a tren1endous transition and challenge to these
women' (cited in Singh. 1993, p. 189). Training covers a wide variety of
issues. Along with n1anagement skills and formal vocation-related
training. the workshops focus on policy issues: legal rights, rules
governing .samity assets and membership. the ability to challenge
dowry, alcoholism. ·rhe agenda is continuously improvised and
revised in resp<>nse to new ideas and new needs. The workshop has
also produced training skills in the samity members. When the
government approached the CWDS to provide training to its officers
on rural women's development issues, it was the samity members who
were brought in lo provide the training. As Vina Majumdar notes in
her report on the Bankura experiment, women's subordination within
rural social relations, their dependent positions within their house
holds, and the drudgery that characterizes their existence had created
a structural isolation which prevented the growth of collective forms of
consciousness and action to transform their lives. l 'he mastering of
new technologies built up women's confidence in their own abilities.
and demands for new knowledge of all kinds - from treatment of
livestock to laws, to ideas about the bigger world outside their
experience - proliferated, 'making [the organizers] wonder who
propagated the myth about poor rural women's lack of motivation for
education' (Mazumdar, 1989, p. 29). One lesson that CWDS took
home from the experiment was the role of particular forms of
consciousness-raising in organizing women. 'We found the peasant
women fully conscious of the reasons for their poverty and their
subordinations.' What they were ignorant of was their 'new rights - as
human beings, as workers and as citizens, their rights and responsibil
ities to participate in all decisions within the family, the community

and the state, to influence the process of change and claim a share of
state assistance for themselves' (Mazumdar, 1989, p. 29). The emer
gence of a collective and strategic awareness of the nature of gender
subordination in place of earlier 'gender blindness' is described vividly
by one of the women that Mazumdar quotes:
We were like frogs in a dark well. No one had thought of extending our
minds. Our idea of wt meant the family, or at most, the village or the caste in
the village. When we became members of a multivillage, multicaste
organization, suddenly expanded. Now it has become so much bigger -
wt
we are a part of a network of organizations. This, plus the knowledge that
we have equal rights, has been like a shot of vitamin in our lives. We are
stronger, and more determined today than ever before. (p. 33)
The Power With: Solidarity and Alliances
·rhe preceding quotation echoes the theme of collective identity that
underpins most empowerment strategies. This stress on the collective
has a dual rationale. First, it relates to the ideological basis of gender
subordination. ·rhe social basis of male domination is often concealed
through powerful ideological mechanisms, including the 'naturaliza
tion' of the status quo, so that women experience subordination as
inevitable and interpersonal. Recognition of the shared aspects of
subordination points to its collectively enforced, and hence collectively
changeable, character and forms the basis of strategies for change.
The second, and related, point is that, given women's disenfranchise
ment from most sources of institutional power, their collective
strength is seen as the most important transformatory resource at their
disposal. And in contexts where norms of seclusion and segregation
curtail their ability to participate in community-based networks, their
leverage to challenge gender hierarchies within the domestic arena is
correspondingly curtailed. The organizational capacity of poorer
women is seen as a vital instrument for articulating their interests
within the development process. However, it has to be built up
through a conscious process. If it existed naturally, then the disem
powerment of the poor would not be an issue. Many of the organiza
tions we have been discussing in this chapter stress this need to build
up or strengthen the networks and alliances among poor people as an
aspect of empowerment.

(;r<>up forn1ation is critical lo Grameen credit disbursement. While
loans are to individual group members, the group is actively involved
at every stage of the process. It must decide the amount of loans to
grant and which borrowers will receive them. ·rhe groups have weekly
meetings during whi<:h weekly instalments of the loan are paid off.
Furthermore, the group provides S<x:ial collateral. the only form of
collateral that the bank relies on. Social collateral operates through
group accountability processes which members have established
among then1selves. Saptagram takes the principle of group solidarity
further; its women's groups are al the core of its empowerment
strategy. Unlike (;rameen. it provides loans to the group rather than to
individual members (with the exception of special loans for destitute
W<>men). This principle is strictly adhered to in the interests of
f<)stering group solidarity. (;roups make the decision to save according
to their n1ember's ability, and Saptagra,n provides a matching amount
as a loan. While the savings and loan programme is what initially
attra<:ts women to form the,nselves into groups. the formation process
with regular meetings and regular savings begins to give the relation
ship a n1ore proactive character. The choice. planning and n1anage
ment of the group's schen1es are the responsibility of the members
then1selves since they are in the best p<>sition to understand their own
circumstances. Ont·e a group has been operating successfully for a
while, it tends to move away from direct involven1ent with Saptagram
and to run its activities entirely independently, with Saptagram
continuing to act as an un1brella organization. Perhaps the most
important effect of such a group forn1ation process is that it cuts across
traditional vertical alliances, such as those based on kinship or patron
client relationships. It offers a f<>rm of organization that they can clwosr
to bel<>ng to, unlike those based on fan1ily, kinship or patronage where
their consent is either not required or which entail a trade-off between
autonomy and security.
'frade unions are traditionally about building the collective bargain
ing power of workers vis-a-vis n1anagement. However, because of the
structures and relations of production within which self-employed
women are located, conventional forms of union organization are seen
by SEWA as inadequate. At the heart of SEWA's organizational
strategy is a model of joint action by unions and cooperatives: 'Co
operatives, by providing alternative forms of production, when
complemented by n1ore conventional union actions. offer a stronger
chance of eradicating the poverty of these workers' (Sebstadt, 1982).
SEWA attempts to bridge the class as well as gender interests of its
n1e1nbership. It provides a social connection to a section of the

work force whose members are either isolated within the home or in
dispersed and shifting work locations. Access to these new and
collective relationships, built around their shared needs and interests
as workers and as women, has given SEWA's members the opportunity
to think of themselves in terms other than those imposed by their
traditional domestic, caste and community roles. Bhatt ( 1989) suggests
that the attitudes of husbands/family members change when they
know the women have the support of a powerful organization. The
attitudes of women themselves change as they participate in leadership
training and workers' education, and understand organizational
processes, communication skills and their rights as workers. The
strength of this dual model of organization is that it recognizes that
women's ability to organize around more strategic concerns is likely to
be most firmly grounded when it emerges out of the organizational
strengths acquired through meeting their more practical interests.
Acknowledging that union organization requires different skills and
strengths to cooperative organization, Jhabvala points out that,
Nonetheless, the two can work well together. For example, to form a strong
trade union, courage, awareness and solidarity are needed. Among the self
employed, women are in such a weak position to begin with, they really
cannot talk about solidarity at the very beginning. A co-operative can be an
entry point into the community and serve as the center of contact for a
union. It also provides a base on which to build up organizers and local
leaders. For example, when we were struggling against the chindi tax, if
SEWA had not already been a part of the community in Dariapur, we never
would have gotten the wage increase. You have to be there to grab. You can
be there through a co-operative. (cited in Sebstadt, 1982)
Organization on the basis of shared interests can have broader
ramifications. The twin goals of the Bankura project of employment
generation and organization building for collective empowerment also
had the major impact of breaking down social barriers of caste and
religion hierarchies among women: 'taboos on inter-communal social
relations, eating together, marriage choices, speaking in public,
accepting leadership of a person considered to be lower in social
status - seem to break down more easily when women acted together.
'l"here are occasional confrontations and conflicts, but there is a
groundswell of change' (Mazumdar, 1989, p. 33).

The Power To: Mobilizing for Change
We have identified the key co1nponents of some of the strategies
undertaken by organizations com1nitted to women's empowerment.
However, unless these ele1nents are translated into mobilization
strategies by wo1nen around self-defined concerns and priorities,
developn1ent organizations are in danger of substituting then1selves as
the agents of change for those they seek to organize. ·ro this extent.
e1npower1nent n1ust entail as an ultimate goal the ability of the
disen1powerecl to act collectively in their own practical and strategic
interests. As Mazumdar points out in relation to the Bankura
.
experience:
NeiLher the organizations nor the t'rnployn1ent to be generated were be
lo
t'nds in thernselves. ·rhey we,·e n1erely be the means of mobililing poor
10
rural won1en to participate more effectively in the wider process of socio
politic:al development, to wrt'SI fron1 soc:iety the rights, the dignity and the
resources to which they were entitled for their own developn1ent, through
t·ollective action to increase their voit·e in developn1ent decisions that
affected their lives. ( I Y89, p. 11)
·rhe clevelop1nent organizations that we have described in this
chapter did not arise spontaneously through the efforts of poor
won1en. ·rhey came into existence through the efforts of other
relatively n1ore powerful actors who had access to the funds, contacts
and information necessary to set them up. They are generally not
financially self-sufficient but rely on funds from other agencies. They
n1ust also retain state approval if they are to remain in existence and
must therefore tailor their operations to fit official definitions of what
constitutes legitimate developn1ental activity. ·rhis places most innova
tive developn1ent organizations in a very contradictory position. On
the one hand, their ability to operate depends on containing their
activities within a non-political agenda which does not challenge the
existing basis of class and gender entitlements. On the other hand,
when empowerment is carried out as a truly transformative project, no
organization can set predetermined limits on what is achieved.
Attempts to analyse and understand the roots of class and gender
oppressions spill inevitably over from the arena of development into
that of politics. as oppressed groups seek to move from redefining
local project activity to setting the overall policy agenda.
The NGOs we have discussed have undertaken a variety of
strategies deal with the potentially political implications of their
10
work. For Grameen, whose goal is the alleviation of poverty, the mai11

concern is with successful delivery of credit to poor women rather than
with challenging the structures of gender subordination. It uses its
weight and resources to ensure certain strategic changes occur in
women's lives, but it also seeks to defuse confrontation from the outset
through a process of meetings with women's fa mi lies before beginning
operations in a new area. Grameen philosophy stresses the familial
benefits that are likely to flow from its investments in women members
of the family rather than the transfo rmatory potential of its work.
Consequently, there may be constraints at work which prevent
Grameen's women's groups from taking on a more political role in the
process of development.
By contrast, Nijera Kori places at the heart of its strategy the
mobilization of landless women and men to press for their entitle
ments. It sees its long-term goal as encouraging the development of
autonomous and democratic organizations of the poor. A review of
Nijera Kori's experience stresses conflicts that it has to deal with. It
suggests that, while at the household level men frequently oppose the
involvement of their women members, such resistance is partly diluted
by Nijera Kori's strategy of organizing men alongside women. Less
easy to resolve has been the resistance of vested-interest groups within
the rural hierarchy. Attempts by Nijera Kori groups to raise the
agricultural wage, to resist the appropriation of government khas lands
by powerful landowners, to undertake their own joint cultivation of
such lands, to complain about local government corruption, have all
been carried out in the face of harassment, often bordering on
violence, of group members. A recent review of the organization
(Westergaard, 1992) also notes that in tern1s of awareness of social
issues, group members have taken action against oppressive aspects of
gender relations and started to settle disputes among themselves,
rather than relying on traditional rural power structures. More
recently, Nijera Kori groups have been involved in fielding their own
candidates in the local elections.
Working mainly with women, Saptagram attempts to combine an
anti-poverty development agenda with the objectives of a women's
organization. There is a stress on building the organizational auto
nomy of its women's groups and their links to wider networks. The
organization seeks to monitor group empowerment by the way in
which group members take up and participate in andokms or
movements. "fhese are generally against dowry, illegal divorce and
polygamy, violence against women and other forms of social injustice.
These movements are generally self-initiated, although Saptagram
staff provide support, advice and information when requested.
Groups often come to Saptagram centres for support and information

"·hen they need it; they do not wait for the staff to come and visit then1
in their villages. Members have been involved in organizing and
leading won1en labourers in rural public works to down their tools and
demand their wage entitlen1ent from the local authorities. Group
1nembers are often called on in the local village courts (traditionally the
domain of 1nale elite groups) to represent women's viewpoint and
interests. In addition, Saptagram has facilitated linkages between its
w<>men's groups and wider movements. Its groups have participated
in International Wo1nen's Day celebrations organized by various
feminist organizations. as well as in the national movement for
den1ocracy which overthrew the Ershad government in 1990. Recently
Saptagram's groups have been involved in a national women's
moven1ent protest against the stoning of a woman found guilty of
adultery by the local village tribunal.
SEWA, too, can be seen as an organization that represents the
interests of W<>men, specifically of women workers. Some of the
criticisn1s levelled at SEWA point to the extent to which 'purist"
strategies for women's empowerment still prevail. Radicals continue to
criticize SEWA for its links with the government on some development
issues and for its distance f ro1n the traditional organizations of the
working class. However. SEWA emerged out of the failure of the
organizational forn1 traditionally espoused by the male left - the trade
union - to take the problen1s of women workers seriously. One of its
organizers describes the paternalism of the TLA: 'The TLA looks at
SEWA as a daughter; when she conforms to orders she is patted on the
back. But when she grows up she is bound to think for herself and
question. The TLA could not take this' (cited in Sebstadt, 1982).
The SEWA leadership has ren1ained aware of the limitations of an
organization of women workers where leadership is being provided by
·outsiders', but points to the problems of expecting leadership to
e,nerge spontaneously from its rank-and-file membership:
With our middle class upbringing we have limits to understanding the poor,
but they also have limits to taking up leadership. With the demands of their
day to day struggle to survive they have little time to assume the
responsibility of leadership. They also carry liule weight in society.
However, with a middle class background, someone like myself has mort'
weight and the ability to comn1unicate with those in the establishment ...
Only creating awareness is not enough. We must also prt'pare leaders. Bui
until they are ready to assume power, we must assun1e final responsibilitv
for action. If we don't, we fail. If the poor had that capacity already. they
would not have been exploited for so long.

SEWA continues to push for greater participation by its members at all
levels of the organization. Both unions and cooperatives are demo
cratic bodies where committee members are elected from the wider
membership. Its flexibility and its comitment to its membership have
allowed it to meet new challenges and to respond to crisis situations in
ways that strengthen the organization. The SEWA Bank, for instance,
came into existence in 1974 as a result of the efforts of the SEWA
membership. They initiated a campaign to raise the legal minimum
share capital required to set up a bank. Within six months they had
succeeded in selling shares worth Rs. I Oto over four thousand women.
When the campaign organizers learnt only a day in advance of
registration that fifteen promoters had to sign the papers, a group of
members sat up through the night learning to sign their names.
The subsequent split with the TLA and withdrawal of its deposits
presented a major crisis for SEWA. However, women's groups from
around the country swung behind SEWA membership in their drive to
raise share capital and the Bank continued in existence. As its
organizers stress, the Bank is an important resource in its members'
lives, not only lending them money but also allowing them a safe place
to deposit their savings, thus safeguarding them from appropriation
by male family members. As in Grameen, there is a stress on ownership
of the bank by its members. Such ownership is not purely symbolic.
SEWA Bank belongs to its members; they own the share capital that
keeps it in existence and they are represented on its board of members.
This gives them a keen interest in its day-to-day operations. This was
illustrated for Maitrayee Mukhopadhyay4 when, in the course of
preparing a field report for Oxfam, she interviewed Sumandatanya, a
self-employed woman who sold dental twigs in the market for a living
and was on the Board of SEWA Bank. She provided Mukhopadhaya
with a detailed breakdown of the figures on loan capital, deposit
accounts, capital assets, number of borrowers and lenders and the
profit position of the bank, entirely from memory. Later that day,
Mukhopadhyay interviewed a bank manager who, after some delay in
order to consult the records, gave almost identical esti1nates to those
already provided by Sumandatanya.
SEWA has linked its membership up to the wider women's move
ment in protesting strategic gender issues such as dowry, rape, sati,
violence against women. It has also worked with other women's
organizations to change policies and laws in India and to oppose sex
discrimination tests, which are leading to female foeticide. It has
trained its members to produce video films drawing public attention to
the lives and problems of poor self-employed women, and provided

·rhe ex1>eriences of the WOP highlight both the strengths and
weaknesses of NGO collab<,ration with the government. They also
point to the artificiality of the separation between development and
p<>litics. As governn1ent employees. the WOP sathins have ease of acces!!
to the l<x:al bureaucracy. an in1portanl resource in n1eeting women·s
l<x:ally defined needs. ·rhe sathiu's role is to provide necessary
inforn1ation, to link village women up with the appropriate state
officials who can resp<>nd to their demands and to organize collective
responses where such resp<>nse is not forthcoming. However. recent
critiques of the WOP suggest that the class and caste din1ensions of
p<x>r won1en 's lives have n<>l received the sarne degree of attention that
gender has. Here stale involvernenl appears to have played an
in1portanl role in limiting the 'decisionable' agenda within which WOP
works. As one recent article notes, 'Whenever questions which bring
m~jor structural contradictions in society under scrutiny or those
which challenge slate policies of developn1enl are raised, they are
dubbed as "political" in the former instance and out of the purview of
the Wl)P charter in the latter· (Malika et al., 1993. p. 374).
Yet, given the explosive potential of challenging traditional gender
hierarchies, these status-imp<>sed lin1itations have left WOP workers
bereft of the collective power of the wider women's movement without
necessarily guaranteeing them stale support either. This came tragic
ally to the fore when a sathin was gang-raped by men of the socially
d<)minanl Gujar caste while she was campaigning against child
marriage in the light of government directives. Despite demands by
the women's groups that the men be brought to justice, there has been
a reluctance on the part of the state to act. As Malika et al. ( 1993)
observe, the state appears willing to sacrifice the interests of 'one'
woman from an economically and numerically weaker caste in order to
placate the more powerful constituency represented by the powerful
Gujar caste. particularly prior to important local elections. The WOP
experience appears to suggest that, while considerable progress in
women's conditions can be made under state auspices, once the
broader political dimensions of gender subordination are recognized
and acted on, women's empowerment can become as destabilizing to
the social order as more conventional forn1s of oppositional politics.
One in1portant lesson to be drawn from WOP's experience is that the
state is a contradictory f<>rce in the process of women· s empowerment.
It has the power to override certain kinds of local constraints and to
provide the enabling conditions for women to mobilize around their
own self-defined priorities. But where such activity conflicts with other

i11terests of the state, it is unlikely to prove a reliable ally. Women's
empowerment has to be linked up with the struggle of other
marginalized groups if it is to be sustainable.
Conclusion
·1-his has been an extren1ely selective discussion about strategies for
empowering women, but it provides a useful context for reflecting
once more on the question of empowerment and how it might relate to
the question of women's strategic gender interests. Many of the
strategies we have discussed here deal with the same basic needs that
figure in more conventional poverty-alleviation programmes, namely,
income, employment and credit. Where they differ, therefore, is not in
the category of needs considered important, but how such needs are
identified and met. What also emerges out of this discussion is that
women's practical and strategic gender interests are not separate and
dichotomous categories, but rather linked through the transfo rmatory
aspects of these different strategies for empowerment. This transfor
matory potential lies in the extent to which strategies seek to open up,
rather than foreclose on, the possibilities available to women.
How is this transfo rmatory potential operationalized? First of all, it
depends on the extent to which NGO interventions are organized
around the participatory modes of needs identification and prioritiza
tion rather than through the imposition of their own priorities on
those who have traditionally had no voice in influencing the course of
development. Second, it depends on the extent to which the rules and
practices of NGO interventions succeed in compensating for the
exclusionary implications of most conventional institutions of resource
distribution. In particular, it depends on the extent to which NGOs are
able to provide women with access to new kinds of resources, thereby
signalling new potentials and possibilities rather than merely reinfo rc
ing old roles and constraints. Third, it depends on how women are
positioned within NGO strategies - as needy clients or as socially
constrained but competent actors. Grameen, which positioned women
as independent entrepreneurs, able to utilize and repay loans; SEWA,
with its emphasis on the rights and interests of self-employed women
workers to a trade union of their own; Nijera Kori, with its concern to
make effective the entitlements that the state offered to the poor;
Saptagram, with its commitment to creating an organization mainly
for women to be run mainly by women; and WOP, with its goal of

in1proving women's ability to evolve their own agendas rather than
n1erely implementing predetermined ones: all these effo ns echo the
waitress in Schumacher's story - they seek to treat women as ·real'
actors in the development prcK·ess rather than seeking to act on their
behalf.
A further transformatory aspect of N(;O strategies is the emphasis
on new forn1s of collective awareness and association. Manv NGOs
,
begin fron1 the analysis that women from the dispossessed groups
within society suffer the silences imposed by their gender as well as
their class, and that empowern1ent entails 'conscientization' or break
ing these silences. ·rhis requires that women are able to challenge the
belief systems which legitimize their subordination, to analyse their
own situations and problems. and to come up with their own strategies.
As Dighe and Jain (1989) put it: 'From a state of powerlessness that
manifests itself in a feeling of "I cannot". empowerment contains an
element of collective self-confident·e that results in a feeling of "we
can"· (p. 87).
However, all these activities will do little in themselves to address the
broader context of women's lives unless they are translated into
organizational power. One of the major limitations of the development
NGO as a vehicle for women's empowerrnent is that it tends to be
accountable upwards to governments or donors. Consequently, there
is a constant pressure to n1anage its activities around acceptable and
predefined agendas. Of course, many of the organizations we have
been talking about have managed to escape these restrictive confines.
subverting official entitlement policies or reinterpreting officially
acceptable concerns in the light of grassroots realities. But there is still
the danger that without an organizational commitment to strengthen
ing poor women's own ability to mobilize around their self-defined
interests, their participation in development and their access to
resources will remain confined to the parameters of local-level
projects. Organization and mobilization are a key route by which
women can link up with the broader struggle for a more accountable
development and start to challenge the allocation of resources at the
policy level. Hence the longer-term sustainability of empowerment
strategies will depend on the extent to which they envision women
struggling within a given set of policy priorities and the extent to which
they empower them to challenge and reverse these priorities. It is only
when the participation of poorer women goes beyond participation at
the project level to intervening in the broader policymaking agenda
that their strategic interests can become an enduring influence on the
course of development.

What we do in the world reHects what we know about i1, and
\\•hat we know depends on how we go about knowing, or in
other words when thinking about change we should start by
thinking about thinking. (Bawden and Macadam, 1988,
cited in Ison, I 990) 1
<)nly by sharpening the links between equality, develop
rnent and peace, can we show 1ha1 the 'basic rights' of the
poor and the transforn1a1ion of the institutions that
subordinate women are inextricably linked. They can be
achieved together through the self-empowerment of
women. (Sen and (;rown, 1985, p. 75)
Gender Training as Development Practice
In 1991, an international conference on Gender Training and
Development Planning held in Norway highlighted gender training as
an imp<>rtant means by which feminist advocates and practitioners
were seeking to de-institutionalize male privilege within development
policy and planning. Greater awareness of the costs of gender
blindness in past interventions has made policymakers more receptive
to the idea of such training as an input into incorporating a gender
perspective within their work. However, what is meant by a gender
perspective is not uniform across the different training methodologies
currently in use. 'fhe report from the Bergen conference highlighted
both the commonalities as well as some important differences (Rao et
al., 1991, p. 11 ). It suggested that one feature common to most gender
training frameworks was 'a systen1atic analysis of the current and
potential roles and responsibilities of both men and women and their

access to and control over resources within a particular system' (p. 1) .
Differences lay in the emphasis given to efficiency, equity and
empowerment as the basis for revised policy approaches. Related to
this, as l\1oser pointed out in her conference presentation, were the
kinds of objectives pursued through different training approaches.
Some addressed the professional dimension: 'skilling professionals in
discharging their duties more effectively' (cited in Rao et al., 1991, p.
14 ). Others introduced the political dimension in their analysis of
gender. Less frequently addressed was a third, personal, dimension:

gender difference held by powerful decision-makers within planning

1nst1tuuons.
The conference report suggested that 'to a large extent, these
differences in emphasis appear to be a function of differing institu
tional cultures, rather than difference in underlying commitment lo
gender equity' (p. 9). There is considerable validity to this observation.
'fhe range of issues addressed by different training efforts seems lo
vary considerably according to the audiences addressed. Northern aid
agencies and development banks demonstrate greatest resistance to
approaches that stress gender as a power relation and the need for
change at the personal level; national development agencies, particu
larly those working with grassroots constituencies, appear more open
to this transformatory agenda (Rao et al., 1991 ). However, differences
in emphasis are not merely externally imposed by institutional
cultures. 1·hey also reflect the 'different ways of thinking' about
gender and development embedded within different training
approaches. Internally generated and externally imposed differences
in training approaches are not entirely unrelated, of course. Like
minded planners and gender trainers tend to gravitate towards each
other because they endorse a common world-view of means and ends.
While this tendency is understandable, it is likely to lead to system
conforming, rather than system-transforming, perspectives on gender
and development. More challenging in the long run would be to
expose gender trainers to planning agencies that do not share their
most cherished assumptions, and planning agencies to trainers who
challenge their entrenched world-views. One step in this direction
reported al the conference was that of the Centre for Women and
Development Studies in India, which carried out training of local
government officials with the village women they worked with (Sujaya,
1991 ). This face-to-face encounter was an effective way of persuading
officials that poor rural women were experienced and knowledgeable
managers of their local environments; in need of material assistance
from the government rather than top-down 'educational' instructions.

In this chapter. I want to explore some of the ways in which the
p<>litical subtexts of different training methodologies are manifested
in their treatment of efficiency and equity goals and their positioning
<>f the planner as a possible agent of change. I will be examining the
content and implications of three different gender training frame
works that have emerged over the past decade and that may be seen as
part of the 'first generation' of efforts in this field : the gender-roles
framework (Overholt et al., I 985), the triple-roles framework (Moser.
1989), and the social-relations framework, which has underpinned the
analysis in this txx,k. These frameworks emerged as a result of training
experiences in response to rather different institutional needs.

national Development in collaooration with the Women in Develop

the World Bank and a number of other donor agencies. The triple
roles framework (the l'RF) reffects the author's experience of training
at the Development Planning Unit in London with Third World
planners from different sectors, some British NGOs and a number of
donor agencies. 'fhe social-relations framework (SRF) describes the
approach that has evolved through the IDS efforts in gender
training:2 a schematic summary of this approach is contained in the

·-·-•rhe IDS training courses, sometimes run in-country, bring together
primarily Third World participants, active in different areas of
development: development researchers, planners and grassroots
practiti<>ners. The rationale for this mixed audience lies in our belief in
the interconnections between the different dimensions of develop
n1ent; ideas, practice, and the institutional contexts in which they are
reproduced. l 'he social-relations approach that we employ helps to
sketch out some of these interconnections. It also allows us the space to
address the 'personal' dimensions of social change: the taken-for

issues considered significant. l 'hey therefore involve simultaneously
suppressing some, and privileging other, information. This chapter
suggests that while both the GRF and the TRF contain different and
important insights for planners, they also contain a number of
limitations stemming from what is suppressed and what is privileged.

construction and reinforcement of gender inequality; and finally
which incorporate a lransformative politics premissed on the central
notion of women's self-empowerment. The discussion in this chapter
will allempl lo pull together, al the risk of some repetition, some of the
arguments and ideas that have been developed in preceding sections
of the book.
The 'Gender Subtext' of Development Policies:
Lessons from the Past
We have dealt elsewhere in this book with the reasons why women
were assigned such a marginal place in early 'gender-blind' develop
ment efforts. The lessons drawn from this experience and the desire lo
avoid these mistakes in the future provide the rationale for training
efforts to encourage planners and policymakers to rethink old
assumptions and practices in order lo achieve greater gender aware
ness in the policy process. I will recapitulate some of the main lessons
from the WID literature as a starling point for our discussion.
One of the major criticisms of development policy made by feminists
in this field has centred on the extremely flawed model of the
household that informed policy efforts. As we saw in Chapter 2, this
model drew on the ideal-typical household of standard sociological
theory: a nuclear family consisting of a male head, primarily respons
ible for breadwinning, together with his wife and children, with the
wife bearing primary responsibility for the care and welfare of the
family. Even when planners began lo acknowledge, in response to the
WID critique, that women (and children), particularly among lower
income households, were engaged in productive work, the latter were
mainly perceived in the role of the unpaid family 'helpers'. Women's
effort was considered 'subsidiary, literally auxiliary, not crucial lo the
enterprise' (Roberts, 1979, p. 64); men retained their privileged place
within planners' models and practice as heads of households and
principal decision-making agents.
The 'gender sub-text' (Fraser, 1989, p. 149) in development thought
was manifested in the very diffe renl positioning of women and men in
the policy domain. As we noted in Chapter 5, Folbre ( 1986a, 1986b)
has drclwn attention lo the locational dichotomy in individual behaviour
posited by liberal economic theory: self-interested and competitive in
the market place; altruistic and cooperative within the home. This
appears to have been transformed within development policy into a

and sought to promote, the idea of the altruistic mother, embedded in
the m<>ral domain of household and community. The efficiency costs
incurred by this misleading depiction of the gender division of labour
at household and con1munity levels have been den1onstrated in a series
of case studies of pr<~ject n1isbehaviour. S01ne of these were discussed
in (:hapter 7. For instance, Staudt's case study (1978) of the Kenyan
governn1ent's attempts to promote high-yielding hybrid maize points
to the productivity losses that resulted because extension staff assumed
that farmers were n1ainly male, and that only n1ale farmers were
innovative. She concluded that male preference in the extension
service was likely to erode the long-tern1 productivity of women
farn1ers, undermining their autonomy as economic actors and lower
ing governn1ental capacity to raise agricultural output. Elsewhere
production targets failed to materialize because planners assumed
h<>useholds functioned as corporate decision-making units under the
control of the male head. Research cited earlier. by Dey (1981, 1982)
and Jones ( 1985, 1986). into atten1pts to introduce irrigated rice
production in The Gambia and Can1eroon respectively, offered
exan1ples of the kind of project n1isbehaviour that results when such
assumptions are not valid. In both contexts, women and men had
separate access to land. based on their complementary obligations to
contribute to household subsistence needs. This division of obligations
and resources provided women with some protection from arbitrary·
den1ands on their labour from male household members. In both case
studies, they were reluctant to invest their labour in a new male
controlled innovation where the implications for their own economic·
autonomy were unpredictable, even if the absolute gains for the
household might be considerable.
One genre of project misbehaviour documented in the WID
literature was therefore associated with attempts to increase economic
pr<>ductivity by targeting incentives at 'the household' or, more
specifically, at its niale head. Efficiency objectives would have been
better served by a greater degree of gender neutrality in the policy
design. A different genre of development failures was associated with
misconceived notions of 'the community' that figured in a number of
social-policy initiatives. Here n1aterial incentives were entirely dis
pensed with. It was assumed that benefits would accrue to the entire

makers was con1bined with 'community participation·. However.

figment of the policymakers' imagination as was the solidary house
hold. Analyses of community health programmes, for instance,
suggested that the concept of community participation was used
largely as a euphemism for the unpaid or underpaid labour of women
within the community. They pointed out that while such programmes
regard the concept of community participation as central to their
success, 'the participation they rely upon is predominantly, although
not exclusively, that of women' (Leslie et al., 1988, p. 308). In the
words of Bruce and Dwyer ( 1988, p. 18), 'the invisible women of the
economic theorist become the all-powerful mothers of the health and
welfare advocates'. The casting of women as all-powerful mothers in
these highly gender-specific policy interventions had the advantage of
dispensing with the need to offer them material incentives. It assumed
their 'natural' willingness to undertake more work in the interests of
family and community 'with more knowledge, but little more time or
money'. The same assumption appeared to underlie one version of the
UNICEF case for more 'human' structural adjustment policies: 'there
is scope for decentralising many activities in health, nutrition, child
care, sanitation etc. to the family (or community) level .. . while such
an approach may increase time costs for women, it will place extremely
modest monetary costs on the household; and will lead to substantial
savings in the public sector' (Cornea, 1987, p. 174, cited in Elson,
1991 b, p. 178). The assumption behind this is, in cost-benefit terms,
that women's labour has a zero opportunity cost. In the light of
widespread findings that suggest that women generally work longer
hours than men (Birdsall and McGreevey, 1983; Leslie et al., 1988) the
failure of so-called community participation to materialize in many of
these programmes is not unexpected.
Other areas of policy research revealed further examples of how an
'imagined community' of interests3 was used by policymakers to justify
attempts to mobilize women's unpaid labour. Rocheleau ( 1990, p. 4),
for instance, notes how a policy view of women-as-resources, as 'fixers'
of forestry and resource management problems, has frequently
translated into 'a narrow focus on women as free (or cheap) labour to
work on forestry projects in the community interest'. Social forestry
projects are renamed Women's Social Forestry Projects; road-building
projects are renamed Women's Social Infrastructure Projects and so
on. The gender-blindness of policy here stems not so much from
ignoring women within policy design, but from abstracting them from
the social context of their lives.

n1akers to f<><:us on very specific aspel·ts of women's lives and define
their interventions in terms of those aspects alone. Home economists.
health planners, agricultural planners, the environment lobby have all
targeted women in their plans on the basis of narrowly defined
perceptions of what women do. ·rhe problem is that women, panicu
larly p<><>r women, do si1nultaneously undertake many of these role~
and resp<lnsibilities, often without pay; hence their longer hours of
work. Developn1ent interventions, designed and implen1ented by
individual sect<>rs with very little cO<>rdination between them, generate
conAicting demands on women's tin1e and energy. Such interventions
are either doomed to failure (thereby confirming planners' worst feao
ab<>ut women's irrational behaviour) or else result in the intensified
exploitation of wornen's labour.
'fhe lack of fit between the sectoral mind-set of development
planners and the inter-sectoral realities of women's activities has led to
the emergence of conceptual frameworks, like the ones we will be
discussing, which seek to demonstrate the cross-cuJting nature of
gender as a developrnent issue. Given the neglect of women·s
economic agency and productive contributions in past development
efforts, it is not surprising that these fran1eworks gave a central place
to the gender division of labour. However, as we noted above, they
emerged in response to different needs, addressed different
audiences, and offered different perspectives on the conceptualization
of gender in the policy process. 'fhus while all three frameworks seek
to achieve a shift from gender-blind to gender-aware policy through a
rethinking of assumptions and practices, they are based on vel"}·
different understandings of the nature of power and inequality.
Consequently they give rather different signals to policymakers on the
question of gender equity and social transformation. l'he GRF is
intended as a diagnostic tool for project planners concerned with the
efficient use of scarce resources. The 'fRF is aligned more closely to
social policy concerns; it promotes gender planning as a distinct
planning approach that takes account of gender differences in roles
and hence in needs. The SRA offers a methodology for integrating a
gender perspective into different aspects of the policy process. It
stresses the interconnections between efficiency and welfare and
argues for the transformation of current dichotomies in the poli0'
arena in the interests of a more equitable redistribution of resources
and responsibilities between women and men. In the rest of this

production processes and ask how they deal with the key questions of
who does what and how.
The Division of Labour in the
Gender Roles Framework
The gender roles framework offers a methodology for integrating
gender-awareness into project design. The framework incorporates a
bargaining, rather than an altruistic, model of the household: 'In
placing women within the household context ... we must emphasize
that although individuals in households may have shared interests, they
also have separate interests, and they may sometimes have opposing
interests' (Cloud, 1985, p. 25). Its basic analytical tool is a matrix of
questions that focuses attention on gender divisions in production as
well as in access and control over resources and benefits. In terms of
whaJ is produced, two categories of production are distinguished: (a)
goods and services, and (b) human resources. The latter activities
(which include fuel and water collection, food preparation, birthing,
child care, education, health care, and ·laundry) are undertaken to
produce and care for family members and are distinguished from the
production of goods and services in that they are often viewed as non
economic and generally carry no financial remuneration. The under
lying distinction between the two categories thus appears to be
between market-based and family-based production.
The issue of who produces is addressed in the GRF by focusing
attention on the age and gender (and class and ethnicity) of the
individuals performing different activities. It also addresses certain
characteristics of the production process: the time allocated (daily and
seas<>nally) and the location of activity (shops, fields). It makes an
important distinction between the question of access (the ability to use)
and that of control (the ability to determine use) in the distribution of
resources for production and the resulting benefits. In a more detailed
formulation of this framework for planning agricultural projects,
Cloud ( 1985) categorizes the different forms that the gender division
of labour and management might take. She suggests that five common
patterns are:
• Separation by crop. Women and men are responsible for produc
tion and disposal of different crops within the household produc
tion system, viz. women's subsistence crops and men's cash crops;
women's horticultural crops and men's cereal crops; women's
swamp rice and men's irrigated rice; women's goats and men's cattle.

• Separation by fields. Here won1en may produce the san1e crops as
those controlled hy n1en. hut in different fields and often earmarked
f<>r separate destinations.
• Separate tasks. Here son1e or all tasks within a single cycle are
assigned by gender. For instar1<:e. men n1ay prepare the gr<>und
,vhile women plant or transplant. Ploughing is often done by men.
Post-harvest processing and storage of cereals are usually women"s
tasks. Milking generally. or milking of different animals, may be
assigned by gender.
• Shared tasks. Son1e procluction systems rnay be marked by jointness
in most tasks; in others. only lall<>ur-intensive tasks are shared.
• Separation by gender of household n1anagen1ent; that is, depending
on whether they are male-managed or de facto or de jure
fernale-rnanagecl.
By offering an series of questions around the division of
upf'11-r1ult'd
labour, the (;RF encourages appreciation of the variety of activities
engaged in hy household n1ernbers and highlights some of their logical
interconnections. ·rhus, if a project intervention entails increased
den1ancls on adult won1en's labour tin1e, the (;RF points to its possible
ramifications for the overall division of labour. Given their existing
resp<)nsihilities. will the new demand be met by cutting down on
wornen's involvement in other productive activities, by cutting down
on their leisure or sleep, or by devolving the responsibilities ont<>
others within the household? Were these others previously idle or was
their tin1e only n1ade available by withdrawal from other forms of
activity, such as schooling or labour-1narket participation? What are
the resource in1plications of these cross-substitutions between dif
ferent categories of labour within the household economy?
· l'he insights provided by the GRF would obviously have gone a long
~·ay toward pre-en1pting the kind of project failures cited earlier in
this chapter. However, the GRF has son1e major limitations in the

relationships of cooperation or exchange. In so far as women and men
are assigned to producing separate products (gender-segregated
production processes), they will need to establish some form of
exchange in order to gain access to each other's produce. In so far as
they are assigned to separate activities within the same production
cycle (gender-sequential production processes), they will need to
cooperate in order that production is completed and the product
divided between the different actors in the process. And, as we noted
in Chapter 5, decision-making control in critical stages or activities
within the production process can have implications which spill over
into other stages or activities. ·rhe gender division of labour thus
implies both a technical as well as a social interdependence between
women and men.
As far as policy design is concerned, the conceptualization of the
gender division of labour as a relation of social connection, rather than
sirnply one of separation, implies that won1en's activities cannot be
seen in isolation fron1 the 'upstrean1', 'downstream' and lateral
linkages that make up the production processes in which they are
en1bedded. Neglect of these linkages can undermine the objectives of
an intervention. 'fhis is illustrated in a review by Goetz ( 1989) of a fish
smoking project developed by UNIFEM in Guinea. l'he project was
formulated on an understanding of the gender division of labour close
to that put forward in the (;RF. It identified the different activities
undertaken by women and men in a fishing community in Konakry
Guinea and sought to introduce labour-saving technology into the
stages of production in which women were concentrated, with a view
to increasing their productivity. In Konakry, it was primarily men who
caught fish; the fish were smoked and sold by women. l'he UNIFEM
project sought to introduce chorkor fish-smoking ovens because they
were more efficient than the existing methods used in Konakry.
Women were organized into groups in order to n1ake use of this ne,v
technology.
Despite its good intentions, the project did not succeed in its goals.
This, Goetz points out, could be attributed to its treatn1ent of women's
activities in isolation fron1 the context of the social relations of
pr<><iuction in fishing. Not only was the focus of the project entire yon
women-specific activities, but there was an implicit assumption that
prc,ject intervention at one stage of the production process would have
no repercussions on other stages. -fl1Ytt·t1tl7ie•tflh·;;ought was

Y,ould be forthcon1ing from the usual sources. In reality, not only did
the women experience m~jor supply problems, but these differed
according to the kinds of s<x:ial networks they had prior access to.
Women who had experience in fish smoking usually secured their
supplies by cultivating ltostament, relations with specific fishermen.
These ltostamt'nu relationships took a variety of forms. They could. for
instance, be between spouses. Alternatively, fishermen established
such arrangements with women in a series of ports along the coast
through an initial gift to ensure the women's loyalty. Women either
paid directly for the fish or supplied the fishermen with fuel
purchased through their trading activities or else provided cash
advances. Koslamenle relationships carried mutual benefits for both
parties. l'hey assured men of regular outlets for processing and
marketing their fish . while they provided women with an established
supply of fish for their activities. The pr~ject disrupted these inter
dependencies without offering anything in their place. Perceiving
women as beneficiaries of outside funds, the fishermen were led to
raise their prices beyond what individual women or project groups
could afford. ·rhose women in secure lwstamrot, relationships were
reluctant to expand their operations through the project for fear of
jeopardizing these contacts. As Goetz points out, 'while the project
fc,cused in the decade-hon<>ured way on women's productive activities,
women were no more autonomous than the men. They relied on men
to initiate the production process while men relied on them to
c<>n1plete the process. Both men and women invested a great deal of
time, energy and resources in establishing ltostamroti' relationships.'
A second error that the project made was to assume that because fish
sn1oking had been identified as a 'women's activity', it could automatic
ally be taken up by all women in the locality. In fact, it could only be
effectively undertaken by those who had already invested in the
requisite human and social resources. Th<>se women who had no
previous experience in this activity had neither the skills nor the
supply connections necessary. In the absence of contacts in the fishing
cornmunity, this group had to purchase fish at unprofitably high prices
in the market or use frozen fish r~jected from the catch provided by
the Russian fleet to the Guinea government. The need to defrost the
fish added to the labour inputs of the activity. As Goetz concludes.
focusing on the gender division of tasks in the production process
without considering their intn-depnuinicies thus fractured a sn1oothly
running system without providing an alternative that might have
enhanced women's control over their activities.

TRIPLE ROLES, GENDER ROLES, SOCIAL RELATIONS
The Division of 1.abour in the
Triple Roles Framework
The TRF is intended to analyse the gender distribution of roles within
households and is mainly concerned with low-income households.
Moser ( 1989) uses the 'triple role' formulation to draw attention to the
multiplicity of demands on women's time in low-income households in
the Third World. Productive and reproductive roles refer to 'income
earning activities' and 'children/domestic labour' respectively, while
community management roles cover the 'collective' aspect of production
(community organization and provision of items of collective con
sumption). While women and men within the household may be
engaged in all three areas of activity, the division of roles between
them is neither uniform nor symmetrical. Women are seen to have
primary responsibility in reproductive activities, but are also engaged
in productive work, earning incomes through agricultural labour and
in informal-sector enterprises. Furthermore, often as an extension of
their gender-ascribed roles as wives and mothers, they are involved in
community management work. Faced with inadequate state provision
of housing and basic services, they may take on responsibility at the
community level to allocate scarce resources in the interests of the
survival of their households or to put pressure on local institutions for
infrastructural provision. In contrast, men's roles within the house
hold are largely perceived in breadwinning terms, whether or not this
meshes with the reality of their situations. Men do not have a clearly
defined reproductive role, though they may assist women in domestic
activities. Like women, men are also involved in community activities,
but mainly in leadership roles at the formal political levels, rather than
at the level of organizing collective consumption.
Moser's formulation of the household division of labour seeks to
raise gender awareness in the planning process by drawing attention to
the fact that women have to balance triple roles and that this will have
implications for their ability to participate in planned interventions:
Because the triple role of women is not recognised, the fact that women,
unlike men, are severely constrained by the burden of simultaneously
balancing these roles of reproductive, productive and community manag
ing work is ignored. (p. 1801)
In addition, by virtue of its exchange value, only productive work is
recognized as work. Women's community management and
reproductive work is seen as 'natural' and effortless and therefore
ignored by men within their communities as well as planners who have

to assess dillerent needs within the community. By contrast. the bulk
of 111e11·s W<>rk is valued. either directly through paid ren1uneration or
indirertly through status and politi<.:al power.
·rhe ·rRF was a ti1nely response to the need to recognize the n1ultipk·
den1ands on women's time, now that they have been discovered b,
developn1ent agen<.:ies as cheap labour f<>r a variety of interventit,ns.
Like the (;RF, it seeks to rnake visible those aspects of women's " ·ork
that had been hitherto invisible to planners because they were carried
out as their unpaid fa,nilial responsibilities. However, it goes bev<>nd
the inclividualistic focus of the (;RF in its recognition of the comn1un
ity basis of n1any aspects of household survival and reproduction.
Nevertheless. the analytical usefulness of the triple-roles concept is
son1ewhat curtailed by its failure to separate out different dimensions
of the gender division of lalx>ur. 1·0 some extent, this weakness in
~1oser's frame\\·ork stems fron1 the fact that the concept of 'roles· is
itself an in1precise one, lending itself to different levels of meaning:
descriptive as well as analytical. referring S<>metimes to prescribed
norn1s (what people ought to be dt>ing) and sometimes to observed
behaviour (what they actually do).
'fhere is a tendency within the ·rRF to conflate resources (the
outputs of the production process) with relations (the organization of
the pr<><Juction process). Separating out the different dimensions of
the division of labour - u,ha.t is produced, who produces it and how -
would add to the cc,nceptual clarity of the framework withour
sacrificing the n1ain points Moser is attempting to make. It would help
to spell out the different goals of hun1an activity; the multiplicity of
labour processes by which these goals are met; and the hierarchies of
authority, power and values that these different labour processes
embocly. It would also draw attention to the fact that the same
resources can be pr<xJuced through different social relations, within
and outside the household. with very different values and rewards
accruing to the producer.
Focusing on the question of who d<>es what. some inconsistencies are
apparent in the way in which the question is addressed in the triple
roles framework. Productive and reproductive roles are defined in
relatively straightforward terms by the kinds of resources they
generate. So productive roles can be seen as relating to the 'income
earning' activities, while reproductive roles deal with child care and
domestic activities. 'I'he confusion arises in relation to communit\'

resources are produced. It is not clear here whether community roles

rather than individual effort so that the emphasis is on how production
is organized; or whether they relate to what is produced, viz. a category
of claims made possible by virtue of membership of community-based
organizations. l'his confusion becomes clearer by looking at Moser's
own examples. As an example of women's community roles, Moser
points to their frequent initiatives at local community level in allocating
scarce resources to the survival needs of their households. Here, what
distinguishes community roles is not what is produced, but the specific
relations through which it is produced. Shelter, water and health
could, after all, be produced in a variety of institutional contexts -
states, markets, households as well as communities. It is the fact that
they are produced in this case through collective rather than indivi
dual effort that leads to their categorization as a community role.
Elsewhere, however, Moser appears to associate 'community roles'
with certain intangible resources generated by community participa
tion and action. Thus, as a second example of women's community
roles, she points to situations where they come together to put
pressure on local institutions for infrastructural provision. There is,
however, a difference between the previous set of activities which
directly produced resources and this set which seeks to acquire them
through a redistributive process. 'Pressure on local institutions' can be
seen as a claim on future tangible resources rather than a tangible
resource in itself. Women's community roles, in this example, refer to
those activities through which they seek to change resource allocation
at community level by exerting collective pressure. If their efforts are
successful, their collective and intangible 'claims' on local institutions
will ultimately be transformed into individual and tangible benefits.
The examples that Moser gives of men's community roles also relate
mainly to intangible resources (authority, leadership) through com
munity participation, which again can produce material and indivi
dual benefits as a subsequent oui.come. The main differentiation made
by Moser between women's community roles and those of men
appears to be that women tend to be located at the level of unpaid
production and provision, often within informal associations, while
men are more likely to be located in remunerated leadership positions
in more formally constituted community organizations.
We can, therefore, distinguish two different principles at work in
Moser's definitions of roles. In the case of productive and reproductive
roles, the defining principle is the kind of resources that are produced:
income and human resources respectively. 'Community roles', how
ever, appear to encompass both a specific category of resources
(formally and informally constituted claims) and the kinds of social
relations through which resources are produced (community rather

participation in certain kincls of social relationships is in itself about
access to resources (the kost.ammt, relationships mentioned above are
one example), but the distinction nevertheless needs to be clarified.
·rhe failure to do so leads to a truncated view of production processes.
As in the GRF, insufficient attention is paid to the fact that most
resources can be produced in a variety of institutional locations
(households, markets, states and communities) so that the same
resource may be produced through very different social relations.
Women's reproductive work is likely to have very different implica
tions for issues of access and control when it is carried out as unpaid

Moser touches on the question of social relations only in her
discussions of 'comn1unity roles', it is only in this context that gender
differences in authority and control in the relations of production are
referred to. In reality. all labour activities can be analysed in terms of
relationships that carry quite different connotations of authority,
control. recognition and remuneration for the different social actors
involved. ·rhere is, for instance, some indication within the literature
that women's ability to participate in extra-household networks may
not only strengthen their bargaining power within the household, but
also provide them with political clout within the community.

and market activities.

attention to the multiple roles that women play, but fails to give
systernatic attention to the n1ultiplicity of social relations through
which these roles are performed. The activities she discusses can be
carried out in a broader set of institutional locations than recognized in
her framework. Her focus on low-income households is partly

responsible for this oversight since it precludes consideration of
production possibilities through different institutional relations and
their implications for women's triple roles within the household.
Moser's reason for focusing on gender roles in low-income households
is, she explains, precisely because gender tends to be subsumed within
class in so much of policy and planning. However, as Murthy notes in
her critique of the l"RF and GRF, equally pervasive in policy and
planning has been the tendency to treat women as a homogenous and
unproblematic category, 'isolating gender from other sources of
oppression, and reducing the complexity of women's oppression'
(Murthy, 1993, p. 13). As we noted al the end of Chapter 2, the
absence of attempts to devise theories of race roles or class roles is
precisely because the language of roles cannot capture the exercise of
power implicit in racial interactions and class relations. The reliance on
roles as an analytical concept surfaces primarily in relation to gender
(rather than race or class) and testifies to a tendency within policy
circles to treat gender in isolation from the structural perspectives that
inform the analysis of these other forms of social inequality.

It should be clear from the preceding discussion that the SRF places:
considerable importance on distinguishing between what is produced,
and how it is produced, between the different ends of the develop-\
ment effort and the means by which they are realized. In its narrowest
sense, development policy can be thought of in terms of the technical

basis of some of the earlier discussi<>n in this book, human well-being is
taken to encompass certain basic goals: survival. security and auto

activities that produce the means by which these final goals are met.
·rhe 'mt:ans' of pr<>duction can be classified as human reS<>urces (the
lab<lur power. health and skills of individuals), tangible resources
(assets, m<>ney. commodities) and intangible resources (solidaritv.

chapters. the latter category occupies a far more important place in
productive endeavours than is recognized in conventional economir
planning, precisely because such planning is biased towards
individualized pro<luction and discrete. tangible resources rather than
more fluid 'social' or 'relational' resources (Berry. 1986; Fleming.
1991; (;uyer, 1981 and 1986; March and 1·aqqu, 1986). Participation

inf'<>rtnation channels. Like other categories, intangible resources can
be a n1eans to an end (as in clain1s and so forth) or they may be valued
as ends in the,nselves (solidarity. status, participation). Access to such
resources is likely to be particularly critical in situations where market
or state provision of social security is missing or where access to these
institutions is in1perfectly distributed.
Most productive activities, whether concerned with human, tangible
or intangible resources. can be carried out through a variety of social
relations and in a variety of institutional contexts. Gender relations
refer specifically to those aspects of social relations which create and
reproduce systematic differences in the positioning of women and
men in relation to institutional processes and outcomes. Material
inequalities other than those of gender are also likely to be significant.
but take different forms (class. caste, race or religion) in different
contexts. Gender relations are ther efo re interwoven into the broader
set of social relations structuring the division of resources and
res1>onsibilities, claims and obligations between different social groups
of women and men within any given society.

of the social relations of production within relevant institutions of

their separate and combined interactions. While these different
institutions may operate with their own distinct ideologies and
procedures, they also share certain common norms and assumptions
which lead to the systematic creation and reinforcement of social
inequalities across institutional sites. As we noted in Chapter 3:
Despite the separation of domestic institutions from the public domains of
production and exchange, fan1ilial norms and values are constantly drawn
on in constructing the terms women and men enter. and participate, in
public life and in the market place. At the same time, because different
social institutions are organized around quite specific objectives and have
their own rules and practices, gender hierarchies are not seamlessly and
uniformly woven into institutional structures but produced dynamically
through the interaction of familial gender ideologies and distinct institu
tional rules and prctctices.
However, few institutions profess to ideologies of gender (or any other
form of) inequality, and the analysis of institutions requires going
beyond their official goals and ideologies, to 'unpacking' them by
examining the actual relationships and processes by which they are
constituted. An examination of the considerable social-science litera
ture on institutions (Giddens, 1979; Berger and Luckmann, 1966;
Hodgson, 1988; c:onnell, 1987; North, 1990) is helpful here. It
suggests that, while institutions vary from each other and across
cultures, what is generic to them is that they are 'patterned sets of
activities organized around the meeting of specific needs in accord
ance with certain rules of conduct and practice' (Hodgson. 1988). We
need to analyse different institutional sites of production, both to
assess their implications for efficiency and equity goals and to
determine the most appropriate institutional mechanisms for meeting
various policy objectives. Five distinct but interrelated dimensions of
social relationships within institutions can be identified as significant to
the analysis of social inequality in general and gender inequality in
particular: rules, activities, resources, people and power.
Rules: how things gel done What is distinctive about institutional
behaviour is that it is rule-governed rather than random. Distinct
institutional patterns of behaviour inhere in the official and unofficial
norms, values traditions, laws and customs which constrain or enable
what is done, how it is done, by whom and who will benefit. The
institutionalization of rules has the advantage that it allows recurring
decisions to be made with an economy of effort; their disadvantage is

that they entren<:h the ways things get done to the extent of givin~

llrso11rr,s: u•hat is us,d. wlu,t is produc,d ·rhe other side of the coin to the
'rules' of an institution is the generation of distinct patterns of resource
distribution. Such resources include those which are desired for their
direct rontribution to human well-being (the 'direct' means we talked
about in (:hapter 4) and those whose value is derived rather than
direct, the 'indirect means' of prcxluction.
Propk: u•lu> is i11, u1l,o is oui, u1ho dors what Institutions are constituted by
quite specific categories of people: few are totally inclusive, despite
their official ideologies. Rather, they select quite specific categories of
individuals (and exflude others) and assign them to specific tasks and
resp<>nsibilities within their procluction processes or to specific benefits
within their distributional prf>eesses. Institutional patterns of inclu
sion, exclusion, placen1ent and progress express class. gender and
other s<><.:ial patterns.
Artit itirs: u•liat ,Jo11r Institutions are organized around specific

objectives and carry out certain tasks and activities in pursuit of these
objectives. l"hese activities can be productive, distributive or regulat
ive, but their rule-governed nature means that institutions generate
routinized patterns of practice and are reconstituted through such
practice. Institutional practice is therefore a key factor in the
reconstitution of gender and class inequalities. In the final analysis, it is
institutional practice that will have to be changed if gender relations
are to be transformed.
J>ower: whodt>cid,s, u1ho.1r ir1trrrsw are sr111rd Finally. institutions generally
emb<>cly relations of authority and control. Few are entirely egalitar
ian, regardless of their official ideologies. Instead, the unequal
distribution of resources and resp<)nsibilities, together with the official
and unofficial rules which pron1ote and legitimize this distribution,
ensure that some institutional actors have authority and control over
others and pronlote practices that are likely to reconstitute their
privileged positions within the institutional hierarchy. Thus power is
constituted as an integral feature of institutional life through its
norms. its distribution of resources and responsibilities and its
practices. 'l"hose whose interests are served by the institutional
configuration of rules and resources are also most likely to resist. and

by the practice of different institutional actors through processes of
bargaining and negotiation; and they can be transformed once a
sufficient proportion of those with a stake in change are prepared to
challenge institutional rules and practice.
A narrow version of this framework would help to highlight the
gender in1plications of the interrelated elen1ents making up different
institutions; a broader focus would help to reveal how gender and
other social inequalities are mutually constituted. The household is a
logical starting point for such analysis because of its centrc1I role in
enabling, constraining and differentiating its members' participation
in the economy and society at large. It brings out the point made in
different ways in the other two frameworks, that women's unpaid -
and frequently unacknowledged - domestic responsibilities represent
a prior set of demands on their labour time. Their ability to participate
in other, n1ore remunerative, forms of production is likely to be
conditioned by the degree of flexibility in their domestic labour
overheads as well as by the norms and rules which govern access to
extra-domestic institutions.
Most households display an asymmetry in the division of resources,
labour and claims through which they secure their members' well
being. Won1en, by and large, are given primary responsibility for the
care and maintenance of human resources. The extent to which men
also participate in this work varies across cultures and classes.
Similarly, men are generally associated with breadwinning responsib
ilities and resources while the extent to which women are active in this
category varies across culture and class. The extent to which men and
women engage in activities which produce the more intangible
resources - autonomy, solidarity, status within the comn1unity, claims
on others -will depend, in particular, on their access to social networks
and extra-domestic associations, and the nature and potentials of these
relationships. Since the household is not the only site where these
resources are produced, the analysis must also consider the relations
governing other institutional sites: the community, the market and the
state. Gender divisions within the household are obviously important
in determining the terms on which women and men enter or have
access to these other institutions. However, each of these institutions
also has its own set of rules and resources. its own norms, values,
allocational patterns and authority structures that help to assign
women and men, as bearers of class and gender characteristics, to
appropriate places within the institution or as beneficiaries of institu
tional activity. We therefore need to move beyond the analysis of
households to examine who does what and how within these extra-

household institutions, while recognizing that these will be affected b,
the extent and forn1 of institutional interconnectedness. Using some of
Whitehead's ideas ( 1990), we can further disaggregate our analysis of
gender relations to consider how il is woven into the institutional fabril
through:
• the culturally constructed rules about the differing aptitudes and
capacities of women and rnen, often ascribed to biological differ
ence, which underpin the structure of claims and obligations, rights
and responsibilities. ·rhese rules may be c<>ntractually specified or
normatively upheld but they have considerable power in determin
ing the character of institutional practice.
• the assignment of women and men to particular tasks, acliv~i,s and
respo,uibiliti,s within the family and in the broader economy on the
basis of these gender-ascribed characteristics. Thus the greater
association of women with the tasks of caring for the young, the sick
and the elderly both within the household and within state and
market institutions is often explained in terms of their 'natural'
maternal predispositions.
• the distribution of resources between women and men to reflect their
culturally assigned roles and responsibilities. Thus in societies where
women are required to contribute to f amity food provisions, they are
more likely to enjoy independent access to land and other resources.
By contrast, in societies where the male breadwinning role is seen to
encompass responsibility for feeding the family, men are given
privileged access to productive resources within the household, but
also within state and market institutions.
• the distribution of skill,; and capabilities. The routinized practice of
certain tasks and activities helps to build the skills that go with these
tasks. In this sense, the gender division of labour has the effect of a
self-fulfilling prophesy. The attributes which give women an
advantage in certain jobs and occupations - nurturing skills,
patience, docility, 'nin1ble fingers', n1anaging budgets- are acquired
through their cultural assignn1ent to the kinds of tasks and
responsibilities within which these traits are likely to be developed.
• the allocation of authority and control between women and men within
the institutional structures. As we suggested in our discussion of
empowerment in the previous chapter, the implications of institu
tional rules, access t<> resources (including organizational resources),
skills and capabilities, the organization of the division of labour and
responsibilities converge to produce unequal gender relations in
Google Original from

TRIPLE ROLES, GENDER ROLES, SOCIAL RELATIONS
which men are more likely than women to command authority and
resources.
• the division of cl.aims between women and men on the outputs
produced or distributed by different institutions. Such claims are
based on formal and informal evaluations by these institutions of
differing needs and contributions of women and men. Thus
cultures where women are both perceived as economic producers
and provided with the resources to carry out their roles are also less
likely to display gender biases in intra-household food distribution.
However, the distribution of claims also depends on the distribution
of bargaining power between the genders and their resulting
capacity to uphold or contest pre-existing cultural evaluations. From
a policy point of view. improving women's access to extra-household
resources may not translate immediately into improved claims
within their households, but it may 'improve their powers of
persuasion' in the process of renegotiation.
For a social-relations framework to be useful, it is important that the
institutional analysis of gender relations is linked to the design and
evaluation of policy and planning. At the most general level, t
analysis suggests that all planning, whether concerned with general
macroeconomic policy or with specific micro-level interventions, has to
be informed by this broader set of social relations through which
production is organized and human needs are met. The gender
impact of policy interventions is likely to vary considerably, according
to which sectors, occupations and activities are affected, who
predominates in them and through what kinds of institutional
relations. The policy component of the analysis, therefore, draws
attention to the different kinds of resources through which policy
goals can be translated into practical outcomes; the different institutio
nal rules and practices through which these resources are produced
and distributed; and the implications of different institutional rela
tions for the gender division of resources, responsibilities and
decision-making power. Some examples might make clearer how an
institutional analysis can contribute to the design and assessment of
policy from a gender perspective.
The discussion of credit programmes in the previous chapter
offered an example of how an institutional analysis of gender relations
might inform the formulation of a new intervention. A comparison of
gender relations within the household and the 'gender-subtext' of
apparently neutral financial organizations helped to highlight the lack

of tit between wo,ncn 's circun1stances and constraints and the organ
izational logic of formal credit delivery. The need for econon1i(
C<>llateral, the urban location of 111ost banks, the bias towards large
scale enterprises; the reliance on inHuential contacts and networks; the
need for literacy and tin1e to con1plete bank procedures: all these
n1ilitated against loans to poor rural wo1nen without any need for <lvert
discrimination. ·rhe Grameen Bank can be seen as an institutional
innovation which seeks to revise these biases against the poor.
Similarly. the gender in1plications of new technologies cannot be
predicted a priori but have to be assessed on the basis of rules, resources
and practices within different contexts. Take the example of food
processing technologies. Where female seclusion and highly seg
n1ented labour n1arkets coexist with a large class of landless labour. as
in Bangladesh and parts of northern India, home-based processing of
crops is generally carried out in wealthy households by hired, rather
than family, fen1ale labour. In this situation, the introduction of rice
n1ills will have very different in1pli<:ations f<>r women from differen1
classes ((;reeley. 1987; Whitehead. 1985). For women who have to
undertake crop pr<x:cssing as unpaid family labour along with their
other don1estic chores, n1et:hanization represents a lessening of their
labc,ur burdens. For women fron1 wealthy households who merely
supervise hired fe1nale labour in rice processing, the introduction of
,net:hanizcd pr<Kessing will simply cut down on supervisory tirne. But
for wo,nen front the landless households, for whom rice processing for
wealthy households represents one of the few wage-earning
opportunities for won1en in a traditionally secluded culture, mechani
zation i1nposes an enorn1ous loss of income.
In the West African context, where landlessness is not a significant
feature, the prot:essing of staple crops is a regular cornponent of the
household chores carried out by the 'unpaid fan1ily labour' of women
in the household. It is an extren1ely tirne- and energy-consun1ing
aspect of won1en 's don1estic work. Here mechanization represents not
the displacement of employed female labc>ur. but the easing of a major
don1estic chore. Thus different categories of won1en involved in
ostensibly the san1e productive activity will experience technological
change differently because they are involved through different
institutional relations with different implications for the division of
resources and responsibilities.6
·rhe relevance of a gender-relations analysis to the production of
tangible economic resources such as credit and agricultural technology
may be clear enough since it is ntore easily recognized that 'economic'
production is carried out through a variety of social relations: unpaid
family labour, self-employment, waged employment, tenancy and

sharecropping relations, and so on. It is less frequently recognized that
the reproduction and care of human resources requires a similar
analysis. The main distinction between health care produced at home
by women in their capacity as mothers and wives, and the work
performed by professional health providers in state or private health
service delivery. differs not in the kind of resources produced - both
are concerned with different aspects of human resource (re)produc
tion - but in the very different institutional relationships which govern
this form of activity. While won1en are, as Moser points out, frequently
associated with the production and care of human resources, their
contribution is not always undertaken in the same capacity or 'role'.
Important aspects of health-care production are carried out by unpaid
family labour within the 'moral' economy of household and kinship
<>rgani1.ation, but others are undertaken through the social relations of
the market and the state. Still others are organized through formal
and informal community-based initiatives.
Here again, different categories of women involved in the produc
tion of health care may have conflicting interests because of their
specific institutional locations. This was evident in the following
example, which comes from personal discussion with Gerry Bloom.
He points out that, given the gender and race segmentation of the
labour market in Zimbabwe, nursing offered one of the few opportun
ities available to educated black women for professional employrnent.
Since independence they have created a powerful professional niche
fc>r themselves in nursing. In this context, the class and gender
implications of sporadic attempts by a male-do1ninated medical
establishment to increase the role of sub-professional cadres at the
expense of the professional nurses are by no means clear cut. The
resistance of the nursing profession to this move may be seen as an
assertion of power by elite women and inimical to the interests of low
income women who. as the users of health services. may find it harder
to gain access to highly professionalized systems of health-service
provision. It may be seen as inimical to the interests of less-educated
women who would benefit from the expansion of job opportunities in
a more decentralized health-care system. Alternatively it could be
argued that decentralization is simply a bid by a male-dominated
medical entitlement to hire cheaper, if less-qualified nurses, and that it
is inimical to the interests of women as users since it lowers the quality
of care on offer. Because women - and men - participate in human
resource production in a variety of social relations (purchasers of
health services, waged and unwaged producers of health care), their
needs and interests cannot be read off from either their class or their

Finally. access to intang-ib/, r,so11rc,J. the most elusive category in
p<>licy tern1s. has important development implications, particularly in
relation to en1powerment strategies. Discussing the informal networks
and associations through which women generally improve their
political clout within the con1munity and their bargaining power
within the home. ~1arch and ·raqqu distinguish between women's
'defensive' associations· as a form of enforced sc>lidarity which is based
solely on women's mutual exclusion from n1ale society (Bujra, 1979.
p. 31. cited in March and ·raqqu. 1986. p. 33) and 'active· asS<x:iations
which establish new resources and provide real alternatives to women.
As an exan1ple of 'defensive' ass<>eiations, Stoler's work ( 1977) in Java
indicates that won1en from landless families typically find opportun
ities for wage labour by entering into patron-client relations with
,von1en front wealthy households. These 'vertical, dyadic' relation

'cross-cut the possible strength that won1en n1ight gain by exerting
collective pressure on a wealthy landlord' (Stoler, 1977, p. 83; cited in
March and Taqqu. 1986, p. 42). A contrasting exan1ple was cited in
Chapter 5 from Hart's work in Malaysia. Hart pointed to the way
female agricultural laoourers, by working in gangs. were able to drive
up their wages.
In general, investment in extra-household associations and
networks is important to both women and men, but it carries a special
significance for poorer won1en on at least two grounds. First, they tend
to be most disadvantaged in their access to state and market mechan
isms of resource distribution; such networks offer them possibly their
only route to material resources and claims. As March and Taqqu
( 1986, p. 65) point out, ··rhe interpersonal bonds underlying these
informal associations are so crucial to the survival of marginal women
that the claims they make on these won1en·s resources can be effective

The Political Subtext of Gender Training
'I'he discussion so far has dealt with primarily informational issues; the
adequacy or otherwise of infor1nation conveyed about the gender
division of resources and responsibilities by different training frame
works. Sensitivity to gender differences and asymmetries within
households, markets and communities is clearly essential if develop
ment interventions are to be tailored to local capabilities. Gender
awareness requires rethinking old taken-for-granted assumptions and
practices so that policies are better informed by an understanding of
the social context in which they are taking place. However, the
asymmetrical nature of gender relations also raises questions about
power and privilege that impinge on the planned distribution of
resources. Development planning is not simply a technocratic re
sponse to neutrally determined imperatives; it is also a process of
struggle over concepts, meanings, priorities and practices which
themselves arise out of competing world-views about the final goals of
development. Nor are all the potential constituencies within the
development process equally represented in this struggle. Just as
'effective demand' in the n1arketplace refers to claims backed by
purchasing power, rather than those based on equity or need, so too
'effective demand' in the policy process is n1ore likely to reflect clain1s
based on political power rather those based on equity or need.
Gender training efforts can promote quite different approaches to
policy, depending on the nature of the analytical framework used.
Some forms of analysis may lead to a concern with neutrality. Others
n1ay seek to influence planners in more fundamental ways. They may
seek to alert planners to differences in what women and men do, and
concomitant differences in what they are likely to need; they may point
to the inequities arising out of current divisions of labour and
responsibilities and encourage a more dynamic view of women's
needs; and they may encourage planners to analyse the reasons for the
missing v<>ices in the planning process. The frameworks under
discussion offer different routes to the articulation of won1en's needs
and priorities and therefore contain different 'political subtexts'
concerning question of social change. Implicit in these political
subtexts are different views about planners: the extent to which they

Equity and Empowerment in the
Gender Roles Framework
·rhe view of the planner implicit in the GRF suggests an essentially
benign and neutral agent who, with sufficiently accurate information.
can be relied on to implement the universal good. The aim of the GRF
is therefore to draw the attention of planners to who does what and
who enjoys access and control. However, while access and control are
useful ways of characterizing aclivities, they are also unnecessarily
static and dichotomous. l'hey suggest that individuals are either able
to make use of given resources or else they are able to decide how these
res<>urces are to be used. However, there is usually a range of
p<>ssibilities between access to resources/benefits and control over
resources/benefits, with differing implications for the exercise of
decision-making power. These possibilities may offe r a route by which
planners can attempt to counter the unequal division of resources and
responsibilities and to enhance wornen's control over their own lives.
However, the framework is silent on issues of equity and empower
ment other than those associated with the efficient allocation of
resources. Its aim is the promotion of gender-neutral interventions.
Equity within this framework lies in ensuring that resources and
responsibilities are channelled in accordance with pre-existing gender
divisions in the interests of efficiency. While passing reference is made
to the desirability of consulting women, it is clear that the parameters
within which this consultation might take place are already established.
In other words, women are to be consulted about the implementation
of a predetermined agenda which has evolved out of particular
development priorities and practices. The reluctance to take on issues
of gender equity, except as a by-product of efficiency considerations, is
explained by Cloud (1985):
While n1any development professionals are sensitive to cultural differences
and unwilling to be accused of cultural imperialism for proposing change in
the social relationships between the sexes, it is comn1only accepted that
development projects can appropriately attempt to intensify economic
change and move it in desired directions. Shifting discussion of farm
women's roles from social to economic terms has the advantage of
permitting rational discussion using commonly accepted analytic tools and
arguments. It pays to deliver resources to women in agricultural systems.
l 'his argument is easily understood, and. one hopes, persuasive. (p. 18)

It is true that there are strategic payoffs for certain categories of
development professionals in using 'rational discussion, using com
monly accepted analytic tools' to argue the efficiency case for investing
in women. The payoffs relate to the hegemony of certain discourses
within their institutions. For instance, a NORAD-commissioned
review of the World Bank by Lexow and McNeill (1989) comments:
'The language of the Bank is economics ... those who are not trained
as such generally acquire the economic way of thinking quite quickly,
whether because they believe in its merits, or because of its dominance
within the bank' (p. 74). However, there are also strategic limitations to
adopting this discourse. As Lexow and McNeill go on to note, it is not
clear that the issue of women and development can be dealt with in
purely economic terms. They point to the 'constraints that this imposes
on those who promote issues other than pure economic efficiency; and
the dangers that may arise in falling too readily in line with such an
approach' (p. 87). These dangers are evident in the GRF's incorpora
tion of the discourse of efficiency borrowed from neo-classical welfare
economics, a tradition in which issues of power, domination and equity
occupy a notoriously marginal and ambivalent place. 'Efficiency' in this
tradition is defined in narrow, technocratic terms (equalizing the
marginal returns to the resources invested in different projects) and
has little to do with efficacy in meeting needs. To rely purely on
efficiency arguments as the main criterion for allocating development
resources will do little to challenge structural inequalities in produc
tion, distribution and consumption. At a more general level, efficiency
arguments may facilitate the distribution of resources to women in
those areas of sub-Saharan Africa where they have been documented
as playing significant roles in agricultural production. But the
productivity rationale is unlikely to offe r arguments for redirecting
· resources in the context of the Middle East and northern India where
gender relations constrain women's activities and resources, under
mining their ability to contribute to planners' definitions of produc
tion. Metaphorically speaking, if women have to compete for
development resources with one hand tied behind their backs, it would
be more efficient in the long run to untie their hands than to allocate
resources on the basis of calculations which leave this prior disadvan
tage intact. However, this would require thinking about efficiency in a
dynamic way rather than as a static response to a given and unequal
division of labour, and would have to be built into frameworks for
raising gender-awareness among policymakers.
On a different point, accusations of cultural imperialism are more
likely to be levelled at some agencies than others. l'he absence of any
explicit recognition of this in the GRF makes 'the planner' appear as an

com,nunity identities. not all n1embers of the cornmunity have an
equal stake in defending all aspects of culture. As Obbo points out.

n1orality for women only. these traditions must be forgotten· (Obbo.
1980. p. 28. cited in Maguire. I 984. p. 3). Democratic consultation
within a community can assist in building up local support for
designing and evaluating interventions which n1ay entail social
change.
A final problem with the (;RF is that it comes uncomfortably close 10
promoting the view that any new reS<>urce offered to women i~
automatically in their interests. One of the case studies (Pyle, 1985)
used by Overholt et al. to illustrate the application of the GRF in
practice helps to highlight this point. The case study is from Java
where the World Bank, in collaboration with the Indonesian Famil,
'
Planning Association, set up a credit scheme for women in order to
promote fan1ily planning. l 'wo resources were therefore being offered
to rural women: reprr,ductive technology and credit.
A prelin1inary GRF analysis n1ight suggest that the project would
benefit women: the resources on offer related to women's responsibil
ities in reproduction and production; women were given specific
access to these resources and presumably controlled the benefits that
resulted. However. further analysis reveals other considerations which
undermine this prelin1inary conclusion. First of all, neither of the
resources on offer in the Indonesian project were intended for all
women, or even for all poor women. ·rhey were intended only for
women in the reproductive ages. Clearly, in the case of reproductive
technology this was a logical choice, but the need for credit \\'as

However, access to credit was made conditional on acceptance of
contraceptives, so that the distribution of credit was guided by
planners' priorities rather than need or even creditworthiness. Nor
was the promotion of reproductive technology necessarily prompted
by a concern for women's needs. Although reproductive technology
has the potential to expand women's control over their bodies, the
terms on which it is offered will determine the extent to which this
potential is realized. In this case, there was a number of problems. First
of all. to promote a single contraceptive technology geared entirely to
use by women was to ignore male roles and responsibilities in the area
of family planning and to place the burden and risks entirely on to
women. 'fhe scheme was thus premissed on a very narrow view of
reproductive responsibilities. Furthermore, there was already wide
spread use of contraceptives in Java. ·rhe rationale for the new
intervention was described by the author of the case study as follows:
'Having attained a high level of contraceptive prevalence, the [Na
tional Family Planning Coordinating Board] was concerned with
achieving high continuation rates and making the promised "small,
happy. prosperous family" norn1 a reality' (Pyle, 1985, p. 135). In
other words, along with high acceptance of contraceptives, there were
also high drop-out rates. A high continuation rate was therefore to be
achieved through 'special emphasis' on a single type of contraceptive,
the IUD. Among the distinguishing characteristics of the IUD as a
form of contraception is that, along with injectibles and implants, it
cannot be discontinued at will. While this lack of control may make it
less attractive to many women. it does make it more attractive to
planners bent on fertility reduction.
The Indonesian project did not utilize direct coercion to force
women to use IUDs, but the tying of credit to its use distorted the
ability of women to make reproductive choices guided by their own
needs and priorities. Such a distortion was likely lo have been most
serious for poorer women, for whom the absence of alternative
sources of credit would make the pressure to adopt IUDs more
compelling.
There are, therefore, some important questions raised by the GRF
case study which are not clearly brought out by the underlying
framework. Why do interventions in reproductive behaviour, surely
one of the most personal spheres of people's lives, escape donor
agency concerns about 'cultural imperialism'? Whose 'norms' and
priorities guide the allocation of development resources and to what
extent do equity considerations enter into the process? The fact that
the dissemination of a particular kind of reproductive technology had
to be tied to the additional incentive of credit suggests that such

technology by itself was not perceived as appropriate by women
themselves. Rather, a policy of fertility reduction had been prioritized
by the W<>rld Bank and the Indonesian government and implemented
through the promotion of a technology which reduced women·s
reproductive choices rather than expanding them.
'fhere is little in the (;Rf that would prompt planners to consider
the need to realign their priorities with the disempowered sections of
the communities they serve. It thus offers a 'safe' option to those who
use this framework. Indeed, Brouwer·s experience with the use of the
GRF for project planning in the Australian bilateral aid programme
leads her to warn that the framework was becoming the development
consultant's answer to the critique that women had been ignored in the
development process (Brouwer, 1989). ·rhe danger with this reliance

Equity and Empowerment in the
Triple Roles Framework
· 1· he 'l'RF offers a very different route into the discussion of planning
goals. It seeks to establish 'gender planning' as a planning tradition in
its own right, establishing a bridge between women's needs and
planning process. However, it notes that the issue of women's needs
has to be rooted in an analysis of their specific situations. Here Moser
draws on Molyneux's analysis of the place assigned to women in
various categories of state intervention. ·ro recapitulate, strategic
gender interests are derived deductively, 'from the analysis of their
subordination and from the formulation of an alternative, more
satisfactory set of arrangements to those which exist' (p. 232), while
practical gender interests can be analysed inductively and 'arise from
the concrete conditions of women's positioning within the gender
division of labour ... Practical interests are usually a response to an
immediate perceived need, and they do not generally entail a strategic
goal such as women's emancipation or gender equality' (p. 233).
By adopting Molyneux's distinction between practical and strategic
gender interests and adapting it to a planning discourse, Moser shifts
her conceptual framework out of the more technocratic planning

TRIPLE ROLES, GENDER ROLES, SOCIAL RELATIONS
domain occupied by the GRF and closer to a concern with gender
politics. The adaptation to planning discourse is achieved by translat
ing the language of interests into the language of needs. Moser
suggests that planning for low-income women in the Third World
must be based on their interests, in other words, 'on their prioritized
concerns':
By identifying the different interests women have, it is possible to translate
them into planning needs, in other words, the means by which their
concerns may be satisfied. From this the requirements for gender policy
and planning can be formulated, and the tools and techniques for
implementing them clarified. (p. 1802).
Just as 'women's interests' are a problematic concept, Moser suggests
that the widespread use of 'women's needs' within the planning
context must also be challenged. 'Women's needs' are likely to vary
widely, 'determined not only by the specific socio-economic context,
but also by the particular class, ethnic and religious structures of
individual societies' (p. 1803). Moser suggests, therefore, that Moly
neux's distinction between strategic and practical can be usefully
applied to clarify the possibilities and limitations of planning as a tool
for change. The issue of women's practical gender needs then links up
to the earlier discussion on women's triple roles; they are seen as
arising out of the multiple responsibilities assigned to women by the
gender division of labour - child care, family health, food provision,
income earning and the community management of basic services.
Social policies geared to meeting needs must take cognizance of
women's triple roles and be sensitive to the possibility that meeting
needs arising out of any one role may have ramifications on their other
roles.
Moser points out that a great deal of women's practical needs are in
response to the requirements of the family (for example, food, shelter,
health care, water) but tend to be identified by both women and
policymakers with 'women's needs'. Meeting women's practical needs
may lighten the burden of responsibilities that women carry, but does
little to challenge their subordinate position. Practical needs tend to be
the ones most readily recognized by planners because they fit in best
with conventional development concerns. Indeed a great deal of the
now discredited 'welfare' approach focused on women's practical
needs, defined primarily in relation to their reproductive roles. While
strategic gender needs require a more complex and structural analysis,
Moser points out that the distinction between the two may be helpful
for policymakers who are open to more challenging ways of meeting

wo,nen's pracLical needs. For instance. locating child-care facilities at
the father's place of work rather than the n1other's helps to challe11ge
the gender division of labour in which nurturing and caring are seen
as prin1arily wo,nen ·s responsibilities; joint tenure in planning housing

politically conservative environments. recognition of the frequent
convergence between wo,nen's prac1ical needs and the needs of their
families provides an alibi for channelling resources 10 women without
such actions being labelled 'feminist'. ()n the other hand, for those able
10 take on n1ore innovalory approaches, the concept of won1en·s
s1rategic needs provides a set of useful guidelines.
·rhese con1rihutions notwithstanding, it is worth speculating on
some of the political in1plications of replacing the language of gender
in1eresls with the language of gender needs. As Moser notes. while
Molyneux does not define 'interes1s' as such, or distinguish bet\\·een
'needs' and 'interests', her analysis is clearly located in a particular
Marxist-structuralist tradit.ion in v.•hic·h the concept of interest is
counterposed 10 liberal notions of 1astes. wants, needs and preferences
which are defined as func1ions of individual experience. Interests, by
contras!, are seen as arising oul of the structural patterning of
individual life-chances by virtue of their belonging to particular social
groups. l 'hey refer to the idea of having a stake in supporting
01·
opposing son1e state of affairs. but encon1pass the possibility that
individuals are not aware of that stake. Objective interests exist, in
other words, regardless of whether they are subjectively perceived or
not (Balbus, 1971 ). Strategic gender interests arise, to go back to the
dis<.:ussion in the previous chapter, out of power relations in the
structural sense of the word.
Moser's use of the concept of needs, on the other hand, is dra,,·n
fron1 the don1inant planning discourse. Interpreting 'interests' as
'prioritized concerns', she suggests that they can be translated into
planning needs, that is, 'the n1eans by which their concerns n1ay be
satisfied'. Planners are thus seen as providing the n1eans by which
women n1eet their strategic gender interests. However, in moving
fron1 interests to needs, we are 1noving between very different views
about the roles and relationships of differen1 actors in society. The
vocabulary of needs emerges out of a very different discourse to that

TRIPLE ROLES, GENDER ROLES, SOCIAL RELATIONS
of interests, and consequently gives very different signals to policy
makers. 7 The language of needs is generally a perspective from above,
'the perspective of socially engaged experts, of the political elite and
administrators' (Jonasdottir, 1988); those who are affected do not
necessarily have to be where the decisions are taken. Consequently, 'to
speak politically - that is, with reference to authoritative decisions -
only in terms of needs leaves open the question of who is to define what
those needs are and who is to act on behalf of them' (p. 35).
The 'interests' perspective, on the other hand, denotes a view taken
from below. The term 'interests' comes from the Latin inter+esse
meaning 'between' or 'among', and the core of this perspective is 'the
demand of persons to "be among" - the demand to be present, literally
(physically), or with own wants represented' (Jonasdottir, 1988, p. 48).
'l'he language of need is thus associated with a top-down planning
approach which constructs, in this case, women as clients of bureau
cratic provisioning, while that of interests positions them as social
actors, disempowered but not powerless, capable of being 'agents of
their own development, able to exercise choices and set their own
agendas' (Elson, 1991b, p. 14). This distinction between needs and
interests would be a purely semantic one if all planning processes were
transparent, participatory, democratic and accountable. Planners
could then be relied on to act neutrally and for the universal good. But,
as we have sought to stress in earlier chapters, national and inter
national bureaucracies are also actors in a struggle for resources and
power. The extent to which they have played an independent role in
the struggle and the extent to which they have merely reflected the
broader balance of forces cannot be determined a priori, but the
evidence shows that policymakers at both national and international
levels have frequently played the role of active agents, rather than
innocent bystanders, in the creation and exacerbation of gender
inequality (Connell, 1990; Staudt, 1990; Charlton and Everett, 1989;
Mukhopadhyay, 1992; Kandiyoti, 1991).
Moser's adoption of the concept of women's strategic gender needs,
in place of the language of interests, serves to obscure important
aspects of gender politics common to many institutions. First of all, it
underplays the conflictual aspects of gender relations and the fact that
men, too, have strategic gender interests which may often be
diametrically opposed to those of women. Men's strategic gender
interests account for the resistance, noted in earlier chapters, to
redistributive policies in favour of women. Such resistance is as likely
to be located within the planning apparatus itself as it is to be located
'out there'. We have already noted the very narrow and technocratic
discourse considered acceptable by some of the major institutional

actors in developn1enl; this operates lo set very narrow limits on the
kinds of change that can consider within their policymaking agendas.
(:<>n1pare, for instance, the possibilities embodied in the World Bank's
emphasis on market solutions to poverty ( 1990) with the UNDP's stress
•>n judicious· mix of institutional mechanisms. Compare also the
promotion of efficiency approaches to women and development
associated with USAID with the notion of autonomy contained in the
Dutch government's policy document for development where the
stress is on 'control over one·s own life and body' through control over
sexuality and fertility, equal access to and control over the means of
production, political self-detern1ination and the right to an independ
ent identity and self-respect Uan Pronk, cited in Lycklama a Nijehoh.
1992. p. 20).
However, it is not just a question of the 'correct' vocabulary. l'ake the
exan1ples contained in Staudt's analysis of bureaucratic resistance
within USAID ( 1987). Rogers· docun1entation of male bias within the
international agencies ( 1980), Carney's account of how local planners
in ·rhe Gan1bia were able to subvert the stated gender equity goals of
their government and their funding agencies ( 1988), Goetz's discus
sion of the way in which class and gender norms shape the
in1plementation of official and non-governmental policies to work
with rural women in Bangladesh ( 1991 ): all make it difficult to see how
n1ale-dominated, top-down agencies can hope to address women's
strategic gender interests without s•>me transformation also occuring
in their own rules, practices and perceptions.
To sum up, Moser's contribution does succeed in bringing planners
closer to the don1ain of gender politics, but it offers a bureaucratized
version of this politics. It does not challenge the mainstream institu
tions to reflect on the class and gender interests which may shape their
own practices and which may seriously curtail their ability to identify
and translate the 'prioritized concerns' of women from low-income
households into a set of means for addressing them. As long as
planning goals and procedures remain entrenched within hierarchical
and bureaucratic structures, the discourse of needs will at best
promote 'an enlightened top-clown' approach to the question of
women in development.

planning approach based on differences in gender roles and needs.
Rather, it attempts to rethinlc existing policy approaches, concepts and
tools from a gender perspective in order to reveal their biases and
limitations and to discard, modify and transform them in the interests
of achieving development with gender equity; the goal, therefore, is
gender-aware policy and planning.
lo
summarize some of the earlier discussions in this book, gender as
a power relation derives from institutional arrangements which
provide men, of a given social group, with greater capacity than
women from that group to mobilize institutional rules and resources to
promote and defend their own interests. In most contexts, men enjoy,
by and large, greater access to food, political positions or land; greater
physical mobility; lesser responsibilities in terms of self-maintenance
or of care of the young and the old; a privileged position in term of
command of labour, particularly women's labour; less confined
sexuality (Young et al., 1981, p. viii). Since the power relations between
women and men are the product of institutional practice, genuine
change entails institutional transformation. The differing strategic
gender interests of men and women derive out of their positioning
within these unequal social relations and shape their attitudes to
change. To the extent to which such relations embody male privilege,
it is likely to be in men's strategic interests to resist the idea that gender
inequities exist, that such inequities might be socially constructed,
rather than naturally given, and that they can consequently be
challenged and transformed. However, the fact that women may have
a longer-term strategic interest in such transformation does not mean
that these interests are transparent to them in the way that needs
emerging out of existing daily routines and responsibilities might be.
'fhis lack of transparency reflects the fact that there are differences
between women, as well as between women and men. Because women
are positioned within their societies through a variety of different
social relations (class and ethnicity, as well as gender), the interests they
share as a gender category will also be shaped in 'complex and
sometimes conflicting' ways. It also reflects the fact that women, along
with men, are likely to subscribe to prevailing ideas about gender
inequality as either divinely ordained, biologically given or economic
ally rational. Consequently, women's strategic gender interests are not
given things; they are likely to emerge only through a process of
struggling 'against the grain' of commonsense notions about gender
inequality. 'Conscientization', as we saw in the previous chapter, is an
important step in the struggle through which women increase their
capacity to define and analyse their subordination, to construct a vision
of the kind of world they want, and to act in pursuit of that vision.

Young's reforn1ulation of Molyneux's ideas in terms of strategic
gender interests and practical gender needs is useful in this context
( 1986). At one level, it retains the tension that Molyneux identifies
between the immediate and the underlying, between what 'is' and what
'could be', in the formulation of policies and programmes. It reminds
us that women ·s practical gender needs, arising as they do out of their
pre-assigned, routine responsibilities for fa mity welfare within the
existing gender division of labour, are likely to be more easily
accommodated within the policy-making agenda than their strategic
concerns which threaten the existing status quo.
At another level, the language of needs and interests signals some of
the tensions that characterize the relationships between policymakers
and those for whom policy is made. As we have seen, the rules.
resources and practices of largely male-dominated and elitist policy
making agencies are themselves implicated in the reproduction of
gender and other social inequalities. Policymakers routinely focus on
the identification and satisfaction of 'needs' as the basis of their
interventions. However, what never enters into the policy-making
process are questions around who is to determine which needs are
decisionable within the policy agenda and which are not; how
decisionable needs are to be met and what resources are to be allocated
to meeting them. These are retained firmly in the hands of the
authorized decision-makers within the policymaking agencies. As
Jonasdottir points out, 'the needs perspective, if applied separately
from an interest perspective, does not require the existence of any
channel of influence from below other than for positive or negative
responses to decisions which have been taken and policies which are
already worked out' ( 1988, p. 49).
Retaining both needs and interests as distinctive elen1ents of a social
relations analysis helps to carve out an autonomous space for women
in the planning process, and allows them to be perceived as actors
competent to interpret their own needs rather than as merely
recipients of officially defined provision. It reminds us there are
certain gender 'needs' that are unlikely to be given any status within
bureaucratic planning processes unless women empower themselves
to identify and establish their legitimacy as a policy concern. However.
for this to happen, they must have access to the enabling resources of
space and time. Women's practical gender needs, and the ways in
which they are met, thus become interrelated dimensions of strategic
interests: needs point in the direction of satisfying choices, while
interests refer to expanding control over the interpretation of needs
and the conditions of choice.

Returning to Molyneux's examples of women's strategic gender
interests - abolition of the gender division of labour; removal of
institutionalized forms of discrimination; establishment of political
equality; reproductive choice; measures against male violence, the
sexual exploitation of women and coercive forms of marriage - what
characterizes all of them is that they entail a challenge to the structural
basis of women's disempowerment. They seek to enhance women's
control over their own lives in the crucial areas of politics, work, play,
love, sex and reproduction. They are the measures through which a
gender-transformative project is to be implemented. However, going
as they do to the very heart of the power relations of gender, they are
also likely to meet with profound resistance. The capacity to withstand
this resistance has to be built up; it cannot be taken for granted.
Consequently, the idea of strategic gender interests can also be given a
processual interpretation. Meeting daily practical needs in ways that
transform the conditions in which women make choices is a crucial
element of the process by which women are empowered to take on the
more deeply entrenched aspects of their subordination. In our earlier
discussion of empowerment strategies we emphasized those elements
of basic needs provision that appeared to link women's practical
gender needs with their strategic gender interests. These include the
provision of new economic resources; participation in systems for
establishing, prioritizing and addressing needs and opportunities; new
analytical skills and awareness; building new and collective relation
ships; and mobilization around self-defined concerns and priorities.
The concept of strategic gender interests has a useful role to play in
gender training. An analysis of women's strategic gender interests can
help to 'conscientize' policymakers to critical points of intervention in
different contexts - legal reform, reproductive choice, employment
promotion, access to new extra-household resources, organizational
activity. It can also help to shape the delivery of services to meet
women's practical needs in ways which have transformatory or redistrilna
ive potential, that is, which help build up the enabling infrastructures
essential for the process of self-empowerment.8 At the same time, the
analysis of male gender interests will serve to remind policymakers of
the likelihood of resistance both within and outside the bureaucracies
to any genuinely redistributive policies. It highlights the need for those
committed to gender equity within the policymaking structures to
build strategic alliances on different issues at different points of the
planning process, across sectors and with non-governmental organiza
tions and researchers, so that they can 'review and possibly do things
differently from the present, and ... renew their vision of development

and their contact and communications with the key grassroots players
in the process (Heyzer, 1989, p. 17).
In the final analysis, planning for women's empowerment is most
likely to succeed when the process is seen as the responsibility of those
who are planned for; when social action groups and grassroot.s
moven1ents help to counter the top-down logic of the planning process
and to open it up to what Sharada Jain calls 'movements from belo~. ..
Until that happens, however, a final component in the social relations
approach we have been attempting to develop would be a gender audit
(of the kind suggested, for instance, in Jahan, 1989) to be carried out
on all interventions with hun1an resource, and therefore gender.
implications. Such a gender audit would provide a bottom-up flow of
evaluative information into the planning process - either directly if
there are appropriate mechanis1ns of accountability or else indirectly.
through informal channels of advocacy and pressure, including the
media and local grassroots organization. Such an audit could ask:
I What are the goals of the intervention? Are they shared by both
women and men? Equally by all women and men? If not, what are
the grounds for supp<>rting the intervention?
2 Whose needs or potentials are being addressed through the
proposed intervention? Who identified and prioritized them and
who was consulted in designing implementation strategies?
3 Who is being targeted by the prop<>sed interventions? ls the
targeted group defined in generic, abstract terms, in gender specifi,
or gender inclusive terms? As household units or as individuals?
How is the target group being conceptualized: as producers.
consumers, experts, agents, v1cums, clients, participants,
beneficiaries?
4 What assumptions are being n1ade by the intervention about the
gender division of resources and responsibilities? What evidence i~
there that these assumptions are well-informed?
5 What resources are being made available through this intervention?
Who is likely to have access to these resources, who is likely

ilities are entailed, are extra resources being made available to match
them?
6 What benefits or gains ff<>w from this intervention? Who is likely to
have access to them, who is likely to manage them, and who is likelv

Conclusion
·1-here is, as we noted in the first section of this book, an intimate
relationship between ways of thinking and ways of doing. In particu
lar, the inclusions and exclusions that characterize different ways of
thinking will help to determine what is considered worth thinking
about and what is considered worth doing. ·rhis chapter - and this
book - have been about ways of thinking about the institutionalized
nature of gender inequalities in the rules, resources, practice and
power structures of different societies, and the implications for ways of
doing development. The world-views underpinning different analyt
ical frameworks for analysing gender and development bear critically,
not only on how policy is forn1ulated, designed, implemented and
evaluated, but also on which issues are considered in1portant and who
are identified as the main actors in the developn1ent process.
What we have sought to do in this book is to extend the analysis of
gender relations beyond their operations within the family and the
market to examine their construction within the planning agencies
themselves. Receptivity to transformative ideas about gender vary
considerably between different institutions. These differences do not
reduce to an issue of numbers of women within the bureaucracy,
though more women within these organizations would certainly help
to challenge the gender ideologies and institutional practices that are
taken for granted within most bureaucracies. Rather, they relate to a
combination of factors which help to constitute gender hierarchies
within any organization: the forms of knowledge that it privileges; the
professional training of its actors; its operating styles, norms and
culture; the resources that it commands; its degree of interaction with
different constituencies; and the political interests that are dominant
within it. (;ender-equity goals would be more effectively addressed
through gender training if it could be used to encourage more critical
self-examination among planners as to how exclusionary structures
work within their own institutions, through their hierarchies of
authority and knowledge, rules of recruitment and divisions of
res<>urces and responsibilities.
-r·o conclude, therefore, planning institutions are neither monolithic
nor uniform. 1·heir governance structures and the opportunities they
<>ffer have to be subjected to critical scrutiny like any other institution,
when thinking strategically about gender equity. However, if women ·s

self-empowerment is seen as a key route to gender equity, an
in1portant first step is the efficient provision of space, resources and
time that "'·ill allow women to articulate their own interests rather than
having them anticipated and ,net on their behalf. Planners can be
valuable and p<>werful allies in this process of enfranchisement, but in
the final analysis the main actors must be those whose voices have been
suppressed for so long within the different arenas of development.

(:hapter 6 because it appears to be a broader concept. I use the tern1

individualistic notion of disembodied free choice but rather the ability of
people to participate fully in those decisions that shape their life choices and
their life chances at both personal and collective levels.

6 A social c:ost-benefit analysis carried out in Bangladesh found that the social
costs of mechanizing the processing stages outweighed the social benefits
because the loss of income suffered by landless women outweighed the
overall productivity gains. A similar exercise for the West African context
might reach very different conclusions. Haswell ( 1988) noted for instance
the concern of local women's pressure groups in The Gambia with securin~
grinding mills, while in neighbouring Senegal, Nath (n.d.) reported that

7 There is an interesting discussion about the distinction between wants,
needs and interests within official policy discourses to be found in Plant et
al., 1980. As they point out, social welfare services are seldom devised to
meet people's wants or serve their interests. In general. the market is seen as
the institutional framework within which individual economic agents satisfy
their wants and preferences through mutually beneficial transactions where
a quid is exchanged for a quo. Similarly. it is in the political arena that people
seek to articulate their rights and interests as citizens or as members of
interest groups. The concept of need, on the other hand, demarcates a very
different arena of distribution and is fundamental to understanding the
normative nature of social welfare provision. Social welfare policies gener
ally entail a unilateral transfer of resources to a group of recipients on the
basis of a perceived moral, as opposed lo a positive legal, entitlement,
something to which they have a right. It is generally made by a more
powerful group within a society to those perceived as its least advantaged
members and least able to meet their own needs. The problem of stigma and
dependence arises within social welfare provision because of the relation
ships of inequality within which they are normally made and their
association with needs rather than rights.
8 Young ( 1986) applies the concept of 'transformatory potential' to specific
categories of needs: 'in identifying women's needs, those with tranforma
tory potential would be sought, so that they can become the focus of gender
equality strategies' (p. 16). While I am also using the concept as a bridge
between the idea of practical needs and strategic gender interests, my usage
differs in that it is not the needs as such that are seen to have transformatory
potential, but the way in which needs are identified, prioritized and
satisfied.
